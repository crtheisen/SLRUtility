Abstract = {{Since the inception of Web 2.0, instant messaging, e-mailing, and social
   networking have emerged as cheap and efficient means of communication
   over the Web. As a result, a number of communication platforms like
   Digsby have been developed by various research groups to facilitate
   access to multiple e-mail, instant messaging, and social networking
   sites using a single credential. Although such platforms are
   advantageous for end-users, they present new challenges to digital
   forensic examiners because of their illegitimate use by anti-social
   elements. To identify digital artifacts from Digsby log data, an
   examiner is assumed to have knowledge of the whereabouts of Digsby
   traces before starting an investigation process. This paper proposes a
   design for a user-friendly GUI-based forensic tool, DigLA, which
   provides a unified platform for analyzing Digsby log data at different
   levels of granularity. DigLA is also equipped with password decryption
   methods for both machine-specific and portable installation versions of
   Digsby. By considering Windows registry and Digsby log files as dynamic
   sources of evidence, specifically when Digsby has been used to commit a
   cyber crime, this paper presents a systematic approach to analyzing
   Digsby log data. It also presents an approach to analyzing RAM and swap
   files to collect relevant traces, specifically the login credentials of
   Digsby and IM users. An expected insider attack from a server security
   perspective is also studied and discussed in this paper. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Distributed denials of service (DDoS) attacks are recognized as one of
   the most damaging attacks on the Internet security today. Recently,
   malicious web crawlers have been used to execute automated DDoS attacks
   on web sites across the WWW. In this study, we examine the use of two
   unsupervised neural network (NN) learning algorithms for the purpose
   web-log analysis: the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Modified Adaptive
   Resonance Theory 2 (Modified ART2). In particular, through the use of
   SOM and modified ART2, our work aims to obtain a better insight into the
   types and distribution of visitors to a public web-site based on their
   browsing behavior, as well as to investigate the relative differences
   and/or similarities between malicious web crawlers and other
   non-malicious visitor groups. The results of our study show that, even
   though there is a pretty clear separation between malicious web-crawlers
   and other visitor groups, 52\% of malicious crawlers exhibit very
   `human-like' browsing behavior and as such pose a particular challenge
   for future web-site security systems. Also, we show that some of the
   feature values of malicious crawlers that exhibit very `human-like'
   browsing behavior are not significantly different than the features
   values of human visitors. Additionally, we show that Google, MSN and
   Yahoo crawlers exhibit distinct crawling behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.

Abstract = {{Forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify
   suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to
   form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability
   to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past
   two decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed
   information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to
   improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that
   transparently monitors and records data access events within a
   virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the
   hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and
   follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after
   the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these
   transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for
   faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the
   changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we
   provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case
   study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable
   information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been
   detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking
   mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple
   disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.}},

Abstract = {{Compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
   (HIPAA) requires gathering audit information from picture archiving and
   communications systems (PACS) regarding evidence trails of human
   interactions. Until recently, most PACS users have had limited access to
   auditing information. Access required resources to handle manual
   inspection of audit logs, and access to proprietary databases was not
   always available. Some vendors now produce eXtensible Markup Language
   (XML) audit logs based on certain events occurring in PACS. However, it
   is up to the user to convert this information into an easily mined data
   repository supporting compliance and quality control. This process can
   be handled in multiple ways, which could mean different audit mechanisms
   depending on the PACS (or other hospital system) used. It is apparent
   that an organized method of dealing with audit information is needed.
   This help may be provided within the Integrating the Healthcare
   Environment (IHE) framework. The IHE initiative defines a set of
   profiles, actors, and transactions that create common scenarios for
   particular workflow processes. The Integration Profiles depict security
   as a fundamental requirement of the framework. Specifically, the Audit
   Trail and Node Authentication (ATNA) profile defines standards based
   mechanisms for securely transmitting and storing audit records in a
   central repository. The data structure defined by the profile provides a
   number of record types that capture different audit events. A general
   feasibility study for storing currently available PACS audit information
   following the profile is defined, and steps to an automated solution are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA,
   instituted April 2003) Security Standards mandate health institutions to
   protect health information against unauthorized use or disclosure. One
   approach to addressing this mandate is by utilizing user access control
   and generating audit trails of the various authorized as well as
   unauthorized user access of health data. Although most current clinical
   image systems {[}e.g., picture archiving and communication system
   (PACS)] have components that generate log files for application
   debugging purposes, there is a lack of methodology to obtain and
   synthesize the pertinent data from the large volumes of log data
   generated by these multiple components within a PACS. We have designed a
   HIPAA-compliant architecture specifically for tracking and auditing the
   image workflow of clinical imaging systems such as PACS. As an initial
   first step, we developed HIPAA-compliant auditing system (H-CAS) based
   on parts of this HIPAA-compliant architecture. H-CAS was implemented
   within a test-bed PACS simulator located in the Image Processing and
   Informatics lab at the University of Southern California. Evaluation
   scenarios were developed where different user types performed legal and
   illegal access of PACS image data within each of the different
   components in the PACS simulator. Results were based on whether the
   scenarios of unauthorized access were correctly identified and
   documented as well as on normal operational activity. Integration and
   implementation pitfalls were also noted and included.}},
