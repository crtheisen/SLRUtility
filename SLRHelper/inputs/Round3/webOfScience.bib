Abstract = {{Objective: To report the results of a systematic literature review
   concerning the security and privacy of electronic health record (EHR)
   systems.
   Data sources: Original articles written in English found in MEDLINE, ACM
   Digital Library, Wiley Inter-Science, IEEE Digital Library,
   Science@Direct, MetaPress, ERIC, CINAHL and Trip Database.
   Study selection: Only those articles dealing with the security and
   privacy of EHR systems.
   Data extraction: The extraction of 775 articles using a predefined
   search string, the outcome of which was reviewed by three authors and
   checked by a fourth.
   Results: A total of 49 articles were selected, of which 26 used
   standards or regulations related to the privacy and security of EHR
   data. The most widely used regulations are the Health Insurance
   Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European Data
   Protection Directive 95/46/EC. We found 23 articles that used symmetric
   key and/or asymmetric key schemes and 13 articles that employed the
   pseudo anonymity technique in EHR systems. A total of 11 articles
   propose the use of a digital signature scheme based on PKI (Public Key
   Infrastructure) and 13 articles propose a login/password (seven of them
   combined with a digital certificate or PIN) for authentication. The
   preferred access control model appears to be Role-Based Access Control
   (RBAC), since it is used in 27 studies. Ten of these studies discuss who
   should define the EHR systems' roles. Eleven studies discuss who should
   provide access to EHR data: patients or health entities. Sixteen of the
   articles reviewed indicate that it is necessary to override defined
   access policies in the case of an emergency. In 25 articles an audit-log
   of the system is produced. Only four studies mention that system users
   and/or health staff should be trained in security and privacy.
   Conclusions: Recent years have witnessed the design of standards and the
   promulgation of directives concerning security and privacy in EHR
   systems. However, more work should be done to adopt these regulations
   and to deploy secure EHR systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a security model that applies the reference monitor
   concept in trusted operating systems to end-user applications, to
   provide a comprehensive solution for securing applications. An external
   security reference monitor (ESRM) has been designed and directly coupled
   with the application to take care of the Security needs of the
   application like user identification and authentication, access control,
   secure communications, accountability and audit, audit log analysis and
   intrusion detection. The security reference monitor is a single point
   through which all access requests to the application are validated. This
   paper presents ESRM as applied to a File Transfer application. Rules
   have been configured to comprehensively validate all input data and
   enforce user access control. Application data has been logged for
   statistical analysis of usage patterns; to monitor the effectiveness of
   the present rules and to obtain data needed to update present rule base
   to further strengthen the application protection measures.}},
