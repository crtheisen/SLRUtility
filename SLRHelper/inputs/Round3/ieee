AB  - In view of the problem how to detect the network unknown attacks, a security log analysis audit model based on optimized clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper. Since the main question which influence the clustering algorithm application in the log analysis is uneasy to determine the network attack type and the cluster number, so we bring forward an optimized cluster algorithm to solve this problem. By means of simulated experiments, this algorithm is proved feasible, efficient and extensible for unknown intrusion detection.

AB  - In classified information system, network security is often described as the cornerstone, and network components (such as routers and switches) are central assets. However, security management is usually based on IOS command only, which may cause the loss of network assurance. This article described the application of AAA security management in certain classified information network environment. To evaluate the enhancement the security protection, we compared the meet of standard for protection of state secrets, account security, log security, operation and audit facilitation by a designed prospective, randomized and compared study. The results showed that the AAA group was in accordance with standard for protection of state secrets, meanwhile AAA security management could provide safer account, more traceable log, and less time-consuming operation and audit. Based on the results, we strongly recommended that AAA security management should be widely applied to classified network.

AB  - With the widespread use of information, variety of security logs have increased greatly, which due need for security log management. Organizations requirements have imposed to collect, store, and analyze tremendous volumes of log data across entire infrastructure for extended durations and at increasingly granular levels. It is the process of generating, transmitting, storing, analyzing, and disposing security log data from network to databases. Due to the wide variety of logs, storing comprises different methods. Recorded events in collection module are processed, normalized and classified. Logs are stored in storage module in order to use in forensic, reviewing, auditing and providing further necessities of correlation module. Routine log correlation analysis is beneficial for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activities, troubleshooting and operational network problems. So log management is an important and efficient activity in network monitoring. Finding an effective log management functional architecture for network events analysis is the main goal of this paper. In this paper, we aim to suggest log management architecture with more common functions that are used by vendors. By studying logging architectures the main functions are administration of log collection, normalizing, categorization, queuing prioritizing and storing logged events/alarms by sensors. Log functions are different but the suitable architecture must justify the functions to send a normative, synchronized and prioritized log in an efficient way. The mentioned functions are gathered from SIEM products characteristics. Suggested architecture includes functions and activities in log collection server and storage server.

AB  - Cloud data provenance, or "what has happened to my data in the cloud", is a critical data security component which addresses pressing data accountability and data governance issues in cloud computing systems. In this paper, we present Progger (Provenance Logger), a kernel-space logger which potentially empowers all cloud stakeholders to trace their data. Logging from the kernel space empowers security analysts to collect provenance from the lowest possible atomic data actions, and enables several higher-level tools to be built for effective end-to-end tracking of data provenance. Within the last few years, there has been an increasing number of proposed kernel space provenance tools but they faced several critical data security and integrity problems. Some of these prior tools' limitations include (1) the inability to provide log tamper-evidence and prevention of fake/manual entries, (2) accurate and granular timestamp synchronisation across several machines, (3) log space requirements and growth, and (4) the efficient logging of root usage of the system. Progger has resolved all these critical issues, and as such, provides high assurance of data security and data activity audit. With this in mind, the paper will discuss these elements of high-assurance cloud data provenance, describe the design of Progger and its efficiency, and present compelling results which paves the way for Progger being a foundation tool used for data activity tracking across all cloud systems.

AB  - Describes typical operations channels for a circuit switch and the generic requirements that should be met to secure these channels. The author discusses the technical analysis of these features, and the major results obtained from analyses of circuit switches produced by various vendors. The general technological trend in switch design has been to incorporate a flexible architecture that allows assigning any operations function to any input port; the assignments are software-driven. The newer switches, in general, all provide this flexibility. All switches have login features that can be deployed on a majority of operations channels. Different switches have different levels of protection against password cracking. Time-out is a common feature among switches and resource control is available on a limited basis. Except for a few conspicuous exceptions, switches generally provide a security log and associated audit features

AB  - Recent security lapses within the Department of Energy Laboratories prompted the establishment and implementation of additional procedures and training for operations involving classified removable electronic media (CREM) storage. In addition, the definition of CREM has been expanded and the number of CREM has increased significantly. Procedures now require that all CREM be inventoried and accounted for on a weekly basis. Weekly inventories consist of a physical comparison of each item against the reportable inventory listing. Securing and accounting for CREM is a continuous challenge for existing security systems. To address the challenge, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has developed an automated electronic media security system (EMSS) for a weekly CREM inventory collection and reporting system. The EMSS approach is to tag the CREM with an electronically readable unique identification code and automatically collect data on the inventory in each security container or vault at a user-defined interval and upon detection of an access event, thus eliminating the need for hand-written inventory sheets while allowing automated transfer of the collected inventory data to an electronic reporting system. An electronic log of CREM access events is maintained, providing enhanced accountability for daily/weekly checks, routine audits, and follow-up investigations. The key attributes of the EMSS include improved accountability, reduced risk of human error, improved accuracy and timeliness of inventory data, and reduced costs as a result of man-hour reductions.

AB  - As an official rule for healthcare privacy and security, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires security services supporting implementation features: access control; audit controls; authorization control; data authentication; and entity authentication. Audit controls proposed by HIPPA Security Standards are audit trails, which audit activities, to assess compliance with a secure domain's policies, to detect instances of non-compliant behavior, and to facilitate detection of improper creation, access, modification and deletion of Protected Health Information (PHI). Although current medical imaging systems generate activity logs, there is a lack of regular description to integrate these large volumes of log data into generating HIPPA compliant auditing trails. The paper outlines the design of a HIPAA's compliant auditing system for medical imaging system such as PACS and RIS and discusses the development of this security monitoring system based on the Supplement 95 of the DICOM standard: Audit Trail Messages

AB  - Cloud computing log digital investigations relate to the investigation of a potential crime using the digital forensic evidence from a virtual machine (VM) host operating system using the hypervisor event logs. In cloud digital log forensics, work on the forensic reconstruction of evidence on VM hosts system is required, but with the heterogeneous complexity involved with an enterprise's private cloud not to mention public cloud distributed environments, a possible Web Services-centric approach may be required for such log supported investigations. A data cloud log forensics service oriented architecture (SOA) audit framework for this type of forensic examination needs to allow for the reconstruction of transactions spanning multiple VM hosts, platforms and applications. This paper explores the requirements of a cloud log forensics SOA framework for performing effective digital investigation examinations in these abstract web services environments. This framework will be necessary in order to develop investigative and forensic auditing tools and techniques for use in cloud based log-centric SOAs.

AB  - Today's growing number of security threats to computers and networks also increase the importance of log inspections to support the detection of possible breaches. The investigation and assessment of security incidents becomes more and more a daily business. Further, the manual log analysis is essentially in the context of developing signatures for intrusion detection systems (IDS), which allow for an automated defense against security attacks or incidents. But the analysis of log data in the context of fo-rensic investigations and IDS signature development is a tedious and time-consuming task, due to the large amount of textual data. Moreover, this task requires a skilled knowledge to differentiate between the important and the non-relevant information. In this paper, we propose an approach for log resp. audit data representation, which aims at simplifying the analysis process for the security officer. For this purpose audit data and existing relations between audit events are represented graphically in a three-dimensional space. We describe a general approach for analyzing and exploring audit or log data in the context of this presentation paradigm. Further, we introduce our tool, which implements this approach and demonstrate the strengths and benefits of this presentation and exploration form.

AB  - Accountability implies that any entity should be held responsible for its own specific action or behavior so that the entity is part of larger chains of accountability. One of the goals of accountability is that once an event has transpired, the events that took place are traceable so that the causes can be determined afterward. The poor accountability provided by today's computers and networks wastes a great deal of money and effort; examples include activities to identify whether a system is under reconnaissance or attack, and the difficulties of distinguishing legitimate emails from phishing attacks. This is due to the simple fact that today's computing and network infrastructure was not built with accountability in mind. In this article we propose a novel methodology called flow-net for accountability. We apply this methodology to media access control and routing layers in wireless networks. We then compare the performance of flow-net with audit log files. This article presents a novel approach for traffic data collection that can also be used for forensics and intrusion detection purposes.

AB  - Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed over the Internet on an as-needed basis. A major feature of the cloud services is that users' data are usually processed remotely in unknown machines that users do not own or operate. While enjoying the convenience brought by this new emerging technology, users' fears of losing control of their own data (particularly, financial and health data) can become a significant barrier to the wide adoption of cloud services. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel highly decentralized information accountability framework to keep track of the actual usage of the users' data in the cloud. In particular, we propose an object-centered approach that enables enclosing our logging mechanism together with users' data and policies. We leverage the JAR programmable capabilities to both create a dynamic and traveling object, and to ensure that any access to users' data will trigger authentication and automated logging local to the JARs. To strengthen user's control, we also provide distributed auditing mechanisms. We provide extensive experimental studies that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

To this end, our previous work proposed a novel logging mechanism, flow-net methodology, for accountability. In this paper, we extend the flow-net methodology and present its design and implementation in wireless networks. We also evaluate the performance of flow-net and compare it to that of audit log files.

AB  - Different users apply computer forensic systems, models, and terminology in very different ways. They often make incompatible assumptions and reach different conclusions about the validity and accuracy of the methods they use to log, audit, and present forensic data. This is problematic, because these fields are related, and results from one can be meaningful to the others. We present several forensic systems and discuss situations in which they produce valid and accurate conclusions and also situations in which their accuracy is suspect. We also present forensic models and discuss areas in which they are useful and areas in which they could be augmented. Finally, we present some recommendations about how computer scientists, forensic practitioners, lawyers, and judges could build more complete models of forensics that take into account appropriate legal details and lead to scientifically valid forensic analysis.

AB  - The key barrier to widespread uptake of cloud computing is the lack of trust in clouds by potential customers. While preventive controls for security and privacy are actively researched, there is still little focus on detective controls related to cloud accountability and audit ability. The complexity resulting from large-scale virtualization and data distribution carried out in current clouds has revealed an urgent research agenda for cloud accountability, as has the shift in focus of customer concerns from servers to data. This paper discusses key issues and challenges in achieving a trusted cloud through the use of detective controls, and presents the Trust Cloud framework, which addresses accountability in cloud computing via technical and policy-based approaches.

AB  - Cloud is a host based network service on the basis of service over internet. When large number of users shares the applications for uploading, downloading and access control, then there will be hazard of fraud access in the network. If accountability is improved, then due to some accountability constraint, system performance reduces. Here we propose the Push Pull key matching algorithm which performs accountability and also improves the performance of system by 56% than existing system. The cloud accountability framework is designed which consist of registration manager, log manager and actual application. Registration manager performs the service level agreement which is done by cloud service provider. When cloud service provider registers, then he gets the key of UID and IP address. Accordingly the log manager built a key and Push this key securely by encryption process. In encryption process, temporal attribute base encryption and advanced encryption standard is used for security purpose. The application filter is used to performing access role of the system. These roles are assigned by cloud service provider after completing service level agreement.

AB  - In the past few years, web-based applications and their data management needs have changed dramatically. Relational databases are often being replaced by other viable alternatives, such as NoSQL databases, for reasons of scalability and heterogeneity. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is an agile database built for scalability, performance and high availability. It can be deployed in single server environment and also on complex multi-site architectures. MongoDB provides high performance for read and write operations by leveraging in-memory computing. Although researchers have motivated the need for MongoDB, not much appears in the area of log management. Efficient log management techniques are needed for various reasons including security, accountability, and improving the performance of the system. Towards this end, we analyze the different logging methods offered by MongoDB and compare them to the NIST standard. Our analysis indicates that profiling and mongosniff are useful for log management and we present a simple model that combines the two techniques.

AB  - In today's age of Web applications connected via Web services, accountability has become both crucial and harder to achieve. The management of authentication, authorization, and accountability in these applications is therefore a very important and difficult problem to solve. In this article, we describe how audit logging can be built into the Web services infrastructure.

AB  - Today's cloud services process data and let it often unclear to customers, how and by whom data is collected, stored and processed. This hinders the adoption of cloud computing by businesses. One way to address this problem is to make clouds more accountable, which has to be provable by third parties through audits. In this paper we present a cloud-adopted evidence collection process, possible evidence sources and discuss privacy issues in the context of audits. We introduce an agent based architecture, which is able to perform audit processing and reporting continuously. Agents can be specialized to perform specific audit tasks (e.g., log data analysis) whenever necessary, to reduce complexity and the amount of collected evidence information. Finally, a multi-provider scenario is discussed, which shows the usefulness of this approach.

AB  - Behaviors of users in a computer or a computer network can be observed by system authorities via logs of all the actions. In a computer or network system, if at some point the fact that the content of a secret file is leaking has been already known, to figure out the reasons of the leaking, we can search partial or entire log files to find out direct or indirect accesses to the file; since a user who accessed the secret before may send messages containing the secret to other users (the secret is leaking due to indirect accesses) via packets in a computer network, or via pipe/FIFO/message-queue/etc. in a computer system, finding the reasons of the leaking is not a trivial task. In this paper, we analyze and simulate the complexity of retrieving knowledge from the computer and network auditing log database for forensics and accountability.

To improve the efficiency of retrieving data, we propose the idea of building a global view of the system with a clustered log collecting scheme to help the monitoring node gain a whole view of the system by building up and maintaining high level log files.
