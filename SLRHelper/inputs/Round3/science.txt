AB  - Abstract
Log Management has been an important service in Cloud Computing. In any business, maintaining the log records securely over a particular period of time is absolutely necessary for various reasons such as auditing, forensic analysis, evidence etc. In this work, Integrity and confidentiality of the log records are maintained at every stage of Log Management namely the Log Generation phase, Transmission phase and Storage phase. In addition to this, Log records may often contain sensitive information about the organization which should not be leaked to the outside world. In this paper, Temporal Secured Cloud Log Management Algorithm techniques are implemented to provide security to maintain transaction history in cloud within time period. In this work, security to temporal log management is provided by encrypting the log data before they are stored in the cloud storage. They are also stored in batches for easy retrieval. This work was implemented in Java programming language in the Google drive environment.

AB  - Abstract
Log management and analysis is a vital part of organization's network management and system administration. Logs indicate current status of the system and contain information that refers to different security events, which occur within the system. Logs are used for different purposes, such as recording user activities, track authentication attempts, and other security events. Due to increasing number of threats against networks and systems, the number of security logs increases. However, many organizations that work in a distributed environment face following problems: log generation and storage, log protection, and log analysis. Moreover, ensuring that security, system and network administrators analyze log data in an effective way is another issue. In this research, we propose an approach for receiving, storing and administrating audit log events. Furthermore, we present a solution design that in a secure way allows organizations in distributed environments to send audit log transactions from different local networks to one centralized server.

AB  - Modern healthcare organizations (HCOs) are composed of complex dynamic teams to ensure clinical operations are executed in a quick and competent manner. At the same time, the fluid nature of such environments hinders administrators’ efforts to define access control policies that appropriately balance patient privacy and healthcare functions. Manual efforts to define these policies are labor-intensive and error-prone, often resulting in systems that endow certain care providers with overly broad access to patients’ medical records while restricting other providers from legitimate and timely use. In this work, we propose an alternative method to generate these policies by automatically mining usage patterns from electronic health record (EHR) systems. EHR systems are increasingly being integrated into clinical environments and our approach is designed to be generalizable across HCOs, thus assisting in the design and evaluation of local access control policies. Our technique, which is grounded in data mining and social network analysis theory, extracts a statistical model of the organization from the access logs of its EHRs. In doing so, our approach enables the review of predefined policies, as well as the discovery of unknown behaviors. We evaluate our approach with 5 months of access logs from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and confirm the existence of stable social structures and intuitive business operations. Additionally, we demonstrate that there is significant turnover in the interactions between users in the HCO and that policies learned at the department-level afford greater stability over time.

AB  - In this paper we examine logging security in the environment of electronic communication providers. We review existing security threat models for system logging and we extend these to a new security model especially suited for communication network providers, which also considers internal modification attacks. We also propose a framework for secure log management in public communication networks as well as an implementation design, in order to provide traceability under the extended security model. A key role to the proposed framework is given to an independent Regulatory Authority, which is responsible to maintain log integrity proofs in a remote environment and verify the integrity of the provider's log files during security audits.

AB  - Despite most businesses having a range of devices which create log files of user and system activity, few actually analyse the logs for information.

As the internet becomes an integral part of the way we live and work, the number of logs generated and their importance has continued to increase. More homes now have broadband connections. Most businesses at least have email and many have an interactive web presence, or at the very least a static web ‘brochure’. All of the internet traffic these generate has the capacity to create useful information for marketers, and more importantly for security engineers, in the form of log entries.

AB  - Every computer action registers a log somewhere – giving a rich source of data that can help businesses identify any trace of corruption within their networks. Log collection is also a strong component of keeping in line with legislation such as Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, GLBA in the US, and the European Data Protection Directive in the EU. Mathieu Gorge looks at what logs organizations need to keep and what standards require their storage.

He recommends proactive monitoring of firewalls, anti-virus, VPNs and IDS logs among other security systems. The main goal is to link a transaction back to an individual user in order to perform a forensic investigation. But it is important to be wary, as some countries do not allow companies to monitor staff usage of IT systems. See page 3 on how the European court ruled that a British college's monitoring of one employee was a breach of human rights. Therefore, linking a log with a person's actions may not stand up in court.

Gorge says logs can give as good an insight into external attacks as well as internally driven ones.

Logs should be analyzed for the following:
				•
User account activity: creation, elevation of privilege, changes, inactivity.
•
Client requests and server response.
•
Operational status: shutdown (planned or unplanned), system failure and automatic restart.
•
Usage information and trends – basic user behaviour analysis.


It is best practice to collect, store and analyze logs with a view to being able to get complete, accurate and verifiable information. This will improve the organization's ability to comply with key standards and legislation as regards e-evidence. It could save an organization from potential liability and repair costs and will give visibility over mission critical and security systems, performance and usage. The main advice is to remain proactive so as to be able to respond to a security incident and comply with legal requests should anything happen.

Mathieu Gorge looks at what logs can do for your business and how governance demands them.

AB  - In the light of recent corporate corruption scandals the requirement for Corporate Governance and Responsibility has emerged as a top management priority, as reflected on the recent regulatory environment and compliance requirements e.g. Sarbanes–Oxley Act. The need for explicitly demonstrated assurance of the financial and accounting information in an IT-fuelled business environment has shifted interest to the information and the IT systems themselves. Assurance of information is based on the art and science of IT audit, a set of recurring tasks by nature both in time and in space. In environments of integrated business applications and enterprise resource planning systems, auditing is particularly laborious and the requirement for automation of auditing tasks was never more demanding. The belief that audit automation is part of the means to achieve governance is developing amongst scholars and practitioners alike. However there is no common understanding yet developed as of how such automation could be achieved across different systems and applications. We argue that through appropriate standardisation of the automation requirements such cross-system implementation may be possible and we propose as a means of standardisation the use of security design patterns. In this paper we explore the use of security patterns for audit automation and we implement them as a means of supporting its standardisation within integrated business application systems.

AB  - The establishment of trust relationships to a computing platform relies on validation processes. Validation allows an external entity to build trust in the expected behaviour of the platform based on provided evidence of the platform's configuration. In a process like remote attestation, the ‘trusted’ platform submits verification data created during a start up process. These data consist of hardware-protected values of platform configuration registers, containing nested measurement values, e.g., hash values, of loaded or started components. Commonly, the register values are created in linear order by a hardware-secured operation. Fine-grained diagnosis of components, based on the linear order of verification data and associated measurement logs, is not optimal. We propose a method to use tree-formed verification data to validate a platform. Component measurement values represent leaves, and protected registers represent roots of a hash tree. We describe the basic mechanism of validating a platform using tree-formed measurement logs and root registers and show a logarithmic speed-up for the search of faults. Secure creation of a tree is possible using a limited number of hardware-protected registers and a single protected operation. In this way, the security of tree-formed verification data is maintained.

AB  - Abstract
Incorporating security features is one of the most important and challenging tasks in designing distributed systems. Over the last decade, researchers and practitioners have come to recognize that the incorporation of security features should proceed by means of a structured, systematic approach, combining principles from both software and security engineering. Such systematic approaches, particularly those implying some sort of process aligned with the development life-cycle, are termed security methodologies. There are a number of security methodologies in the literature, of which the most flexible and, according to a recent survey, most satisfactory from an industry-adoption viewpoint are methodologies that encapsulate their security solutions in some fashion, especially via the use of security patterns. While the literature does present several mature pattern-driven security methodologies with either a general or a highly specific system applicability, there are currently no (pattern-driven) security methodologies specifically designed for general distributed systems. Going further, there are also currently no methodologies with mixed specific applicability, e.g. for both general and peer-to-peer distributed systems. In this paper we aim to fill these gaps by presenting a comprehensive pattern-driven security methodology – arrived at by applying a previously devised approach to engineering security methodologies – specifically designed for general distributed systems, which is also capable of taking into account the specifics of peer-to-peer systems as needed. Our methodology takes the principle of encapsulation several steps further, by employing patterns not only for the incorporation of security features (via security solution frames), but also for the modeling of threats, and even as part of its process. We illustrate and evaluate the presented methodology in detail via a realistic example – the development of a distributed system for file sharing and collaborative editing. In both the presentation of the methodology and example our focus is on the early life-cycle phases (analysis and design).

AB  - Increasingly, new regulations are governing organizations and their information systems. Individuals responsible for ensuring legal compliance and accountability currently lack sufficient guidance and support to manage their legal obligations within relevant information systems. While software controls provide assurances that business processes adhere to specific requirements, such as those derived from government regulations, there is little support to manage these requirements and their relationships to various policies and regulations. We propose a requirements management framework that enables executives, business managers, software developers and auditors to distribute legal obligations across business units and/or personnel with different roles and technical capabilities. This framework improves accountability by integrating traceability throughout the policy and requirements lifecycle. We illustrate the framework within the context of a concrete healthcare scenario in which obligations incurred from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are delegated and refined into software requirements. Additionally, we show how auditing mechanisms can be integrated into the framework and how auditors can certify that specific chains of delegation and refinement decisions comply with government regulations.

The cloud computing exhibits, remarkable potential to provide cost effective, easy to manage, elastic, and powerful resources on the fly, over the Internet. The cloud computing, upsurges the capabilities of the hardware resources by optimal and shared utilization. The above mentioned features encourage the organizations and individual users to shift their applications and services to the cloud. Even the critical infrastructure, for example, power generation and distribution plants are being migrated to the cloud computing paradigm. However, the services provided by third-party cloud service providers entail additional security threats. The migration of user’s assets (data, applications, etc.) outside the administrative control in a shared environment where numerous users are collocated escalates the security concerns. This survey details the security issues that arise due to the very nature of cloud computing. Moreover, the survey presents the recent solutions presented in the literature to counter the security issues. Furthermore, a brief view of security vulnerabilities in the mobile cloud computing are also highlighted. In the end, the discussion on the open issues and future research directions is also presented.

I this paper we show how the framework can be used in a practical scenario. In particular, we work out the example of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, we outline the full architecture needed for audit-based access control and we discuss the requirements and limitations of this approach concerning the underlying infrastructure and its users.

AB  - This paper describes some of the findings of a cloud research project the authors carried out in Q2/2011. As part of the project, the authors first identified security concerns related to cloud computing, and gaps in cloud-related standards/regulations. The authors then identified several hard-to-implement, but highly cloud-relevant, security requirements in numerous cloud (and non-cloud) regulations and guidance documents, especially related to “least privilege”, “information flow control”, and “incident monitoring/auditing/analysis”. Further study revealed that there are significant cloud technology gaps in cloud (and non-cloud) platforms, which make it difficult to effectively implement those security policy requirements. The project concluded that model-driven security policy automation offered as a cloud service and tied into the protected cloud platform is ideally suited to achieve correct, consistent, low-effort/cost policy implementation for cloud applications.

AB  - As an official regulation for healthcare privacy and security, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates health institutions to protect health information against unauthorized use or disclosure. One such method proposed by HIPAA Security Standards is audit trail, which records and examines health information access activities. HIPAA mandates healthcare providers to have the ability to generate audit trails on data access activities for any specific patient. Although current medical imaging systems generate activity logs, there is a lack of formal methodology to interpret these large volumes of log data and generate HIPAA compliant auditing trails.

This paper outlines the design of a HIPAA compliant auditing system (HCAS) for medical images in imaging systems such as PACS and discusses the development of a security monitoring (SM) toolkit based on some of the partial components in HCAS.

AB  - Objective
To report the results of a systematic literature review concerning the security and privacy of electronic health record (EHR) systems.
Data sources
Original articles written in English found in MEDLINE, ACM Digital Library, Wiley InterScience, IEEE Digital Library, Science@Direct, MetaPress, ERIC, CINAHL and Trip Database.
Study selection
Only those articles dealing with the security and privacy of EHR systems.
Data extraction
The extraction of 775 articles using a predefined search string, the outcome of which was reviewed by three authors and checked by a fourth.
Results
A total of 49 articles were selected, of which 26 used standards or regulations related to the privacy and security of EHR data. The most widely used regulations are the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. We found 23 articles that used symmetric key and/or asymmetric key schemes and 13 articles that employed the pseudo anonymity technique in EHR systems. A total of 11 articles propose the use of a digital signature scheme based on PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and 13 articles propose a login/password (seven of them combined with a digital certificate or PIN) for authentication. The preferred access control model appears to be Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), since it is used in 27 studies. Ten of these studies discuss who should define the EHR systems’ roles. Eleven studies discuss who should provide access to EHR data: patients or health entities. Sixteen of the articles reviewed indicate that it is necessary to override defined access policies in the case of an emergency. In 25 articles an audit-log of the system is produced. Only four studies mention that system users and/or health staff should be trained in security and privacy.
Conclusions
Recent years have witnessed the design of standards and the promulgation of directives concerning security and privacy in EHR systems. However, more work should be done to adopt these regulations and to deploy secure EHR systems.

AB  - Current digital forensics methods capture, preserve, and analyze digital evidence in general-purpose electronic containers (typically, plain files) with no dedicated support to help establish that the evidence has been properly handled. Auditing of a digital investigation, from identification and seizure of evidence through duplication and investigation is, essentially, ad hoc, recorded in separate log files or in an investigator's case notebook. Auditing performed in this fashion is bound to be incomplete, because different tools provide widely disparate amounts of auditing information – including none at all – and there is ample room for human error. The latter is a particularly pressing concern given the fast growth of the size of forensic targets.

Recently, there has been a serious community effort to develop an open standard for specialized digital evidence containers (DECs). A DEC differs from a general purpose container in that, in addition to the actual evidence, it bundles arbitrary metadata associated with it, such as logs and notes, and provides the basic means to detect evidence-tampering through digital signatures. Current approaches consist of defining a container format and providing a specialized library that can be used to manipulate it. While a big step in the right direction, this approach has some non-trivial shortcomings – it requires the retooling of existing forensic software and, thereby, limits the number of tools available to the investigator. More importantly, however, it does not provide a complete solution since it only records snapshots of the state of the DEC without being able to provide a trusted log of all data operations actually performed on the evidence. Without a trusted log the question of whether a tool worked exactly as advertised cannot be answered with certainty, which opens the door to challenges (both legitimate and frivolous) of the results.

In this paper, we propose a complementary mechanism, called the Forensic Discovery Auditing Module (FDAM), aimed at closing this loophole in the discovery process. FDAM can be thought of as a ‘clean-room’ environment for the manipulation of digital evidence, where evidence from containers is placed for controlled manipulation. It functions as an operating system component, which monitors and logs all access to the evidence and enforces policy restrictions. This allows the immediate, safe, and verifiable use of any tool deemed necessary by the examiner. In addition, the module can provide transparent support for multiple DEC formats, thereby greatly simplifying the adoption of open standards.

AB  - Australian State and Commonwealth Governments are interested in the collection, storage and presentation of audit trail information, particularly within a legal framework. Law enforcement agencies have a legal obligation to keep audit records of all activity on information systems used within their operations. Little to no research has been identified in relation to the use of internal audit systems for evidentiary purpose.

A brief history of audit trails is given with requirements for such audit trails beyond the year 2000.

The Queensland Police Service (QPS), Australia, is used as a major case study . Information on principles, techniques and processes used, and the reason for the recording, storing and releasing of audit information for evidentiary purposes have been studied.

To assist in determining current practice in the Australian Commonwealth and State Governments the results of an Australia wide survey of all government departments are given and contrasted to the major study for QPS.

Reference is also made to the legal obligations for authorization of audit analysis, expert witnessing and legal precedence in relation to court acceptance or rejection of audit information used in evidence.

It is shown that most organizations studied generate and retain audit trails but the approach is not consistent nor is it comprehensive. It is suggested that these materials would not withstand a serious legal challenge.

AB  - Multi-agent systems (MAS) are a relatively new software paradigm that is being widely accepted in several application domains to address large and complex tasks. However, with the use of MAS in open, distributed and heterogeneous applications, the security issues may endanger the success of the application. The goal of this research is to identify the security issues faced by MAS and to survey the current state of the art of this field of knowledge. In order to do it, this paper examines the basic concepts of security in computing, and some characteristics of agents and multi-agent systems that introduce new threats and ways to attack. After this, some models and architectures proposed in the literature are presented and analyzed.

Identification and analysis of privacy and security related issues that occur when health information is exchanged between health care organizations.
Methods
Based on a generic scenario questions were formulated to reveal the occurring issues. Possible answers were verified in literature.
Results
Ensuring secure health information exchange across organizations requires a standardization of security measures that goes beyond organizational boundaries, such as global definitions of professional roles, global standards for patient consent and semantic interoperable audit logs.
Conclusion
As to be able to fully address the privacy and security issues in interoperable EHRs and the long-life virtual EHR it is necessary to realize a paradigm shift from storing all incoming information in a local system to retrieving information from external systems whenever that information is deemed necessary for the care of the patient.

Incident handling strategy is one key strategy to mitigate risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) of organisation assets, as well as minimising loss (e.g. financial, reputational and legal) particularly as organisations move to the cloud. In this paper, we surveyed existing incident handling and digital forensic literature with the aims of contributing to the knowledge gap(s) in handling incidents in the cloud environment. 139 English language publications between January 2009 and May 2014 were located by searching various sources including the websites of standard bodies (e.g. National Institute of Standards and Technology) and academic databases (e.g. Google Scholar, IEEEXplore, ACM Digital Library, Springer and ScienceDirect). We then propose a conceptual cloud incident handling model that brings together incident handling, digital forensic and the Capability Maturity Model for Services to more effectively handle incidents for organisations using the cloud. A discussion of open research issues concludes this survey.

AB  - As service-oriented computing becomes more prevalent, an increasing number of applications will be developed using existing software components with standard interfaces. These components may be developed in-house, may represent purchased software, or may involve vendor located leased services. The use of multiple services, possibly utilizing different technologies and different sources, has significant implications for the performance and security of these applications to support a business process effectively. Estimating performance and security in this distributed environment is a hard problem. This paper examines how performance and security measures can be developed for service-based applications. Business processes are broken down into constituent tasks and a formal mechanism is developed for deriving performance and security measures for the application. Given the competing nature of these two objectives, a tradeoff strategy is utilized wherein managers can trade improved performance for reduced security or vice versa. As the number of alternative services for each task increases, the composition problem becomes combinatorially explosive. A genetic algorithm approach is adopted to find the Pareto optimal set of services that can be assembled to support the business process. An application to a real-world business process illustrates its effectiveness.

AB  - Summary
The purpose of this short paper is to create a generic administrative framework in which the operational management of information systems may be supported by effective auditing process.

Emphasis is placed on agreeing a set of overall control principles which may be mapped from the human world to that of the technologically based information systems. Five intial principles have been recognised. This list may be extended as the practical problems of managing and auditing security information systems, especially in the non-Defence sector, are explored.

The objectives of functionally rich, IT ‘open systems’ solutions are used to illustrate the requirements. Where relevant, specific ‘open’ standards activities (especially ISO, CCITT, ect) are referenced as the basis of future development.

AB  - To protect information systems from increasing levels of cyber threats, organizations are compelled to institute security programs. Because information security policies are a necessary foundation of organizational security programs, there exists a need for scholarly contributions in this important area. Using a methodology involving qualitative techniques, we develop an information security policy process model based on responses from a sample of certified information security professionals. As the primary contribution of this research study, the proposed model illustrates a general yet comprehensive policy process in a distinctive form not found in existing professional standards or academic publications. This study's model goes beyond the models illustrated in the literature by depicting a larger organizational context that includes key external and internal influences that can materially impact organizational processes. The model that evolved from the data in this research reflects the recommended practices of our sample of certified professionals, thus providing a practical representation of an information security policy process for modern organizations. Before offering our concluding comments, we compare the results of the study with the literature in both theory and practice and also discuss limitations of the study. To the benefit of the practitioner and research communities alike, the model in this study offers a step forward, as well as an opportunity for making further advancements in the increasingly critical area of information security policy.

Therefore, we foster a model-driven transformation approach from modelled security goals in the context of process models to concrete security implementations. We argue that specific types of security goals may be expressed in a graphical fashion at the business process modelling level which in turn can be transformed into corresponding access control and security policies. In this paper we present security policy and policy constraint models. We further discuss a translation of security annotated business processes into platform specific target languages, such as XACML or AXIS2 security configurations. To demonstrate the suitability of this approach an example transformation is presented based on an annotated process.

AB  - This paper provides an extensive survey of the different methods of addressing security issues in the grid computing environment, and specifically contributes to the research environment by developing a comprehensive framework for classification of these research endeavors. The framework presented classifies security literature into System Solutions, Behavioral Solutions, Hybrid Solutions and Related Technologies. Each one of these categories is explained in detail in the paper to provide insight as to their unique methods of accomplishing grid security, the types of grid and security situations they apply best to, and the pros and cons for each type of solution. Further, several areas of research were identified in the course of the literature survey where more study is warranted. These avenues for future research are also discussed in this paper. Several types of grid systems exist currently, and the security needs and solutions to address those needs for each type vary as much as the types of systems themselves. This research framework will aid in future research efforts to define, analyze, and address grid security problems for the many varied types of grid setups, as well as the many security situations that each grid may face.

The managers of each of those employees must be directly accountable for the individual's supervision. The same suggestions which are described for ISSO supervision apply to ISA supervision. Further, each is in a unique position to audit the activities of the other. Recommendations are provided to accomplish this “audit of the auditors.”

AB  - In 1996 New Zealand had introduced security standard AS/NZCS 4444 based on the British Standard BS 7799, which has recently been accepted as an international standard ISO 17799. This standard is very often referred to as the ‘baseline lane approach’ to the issue of managing information security. On the other hand the health information systems (HIS) are undergoing rapid development both in the number of installed systems as in the law and regulations governing HIS developments and deployment. The project was aimed at reviewing the AS/NZCS 4444 standard from the HIS requirements point of view. In this paper, we began with an overview of healthcare information systems (HIS) infrastructure in New Zealand and associated security issues around privacy and confidentiality, followed by a general review of the security baseline approach. We analyzed each clause of the AS/NZS 4444 with the information collected about technical and non-technical approaches to protecting HIS, consisting of a series of multi-case studies of healthcare organizations that collect, process, store and transmit electronic medical records. Finally, we proposed a new set of information security baselines based on the research to build an information security model for healthcare organizations.

However, for this technology to make the step out of the labs and penetrate the market, the security problems have to be tackled effectively. This paper demonstrates why and how agent technology research, can and should be applied to active networks, in order to fulfill the new security challenges this infrastructure poses. First, we identify the key elements of AN, analyze the nature of active code, specify the role of agents in active networks and present a multi-execution environment active network architecture. Then, we target the security threats for active code and execution environment, and state the basic as well as the extended security requirements. Subsequently, we try to see how we can apply the security solutions and research done for agents to the context of active networks in order to satisfy their requirements.

AB  - System and process auditors assure – from an information processing perspective – the correctness and integrity of the data that is aggregated in a company’s financial statements. To do so, they assess whether a company’s business processes and information systems process financial data correctly. The audit process is a complex endeavor that in practice has to rely on simplifying assumptions. These simplifying assumptions mainly result from the need to restrict the audit scope and to focus it on the major risks. This article describes a generalized audit process. According to our experience with this process, there is a risk that material deficiencies remain undiscovered when said simplifying assumptions are not satisfied. To address this risk of deficiencies, the article compiles thirteen control patterns, which – according to our experience – are particularly suited to help information systems satisfy the simplifying assumptions. As such, use of these proven control patterns makes information systems easier to audit and IT architects can use them to build systems that meet audit requirements by design. Additionally, the practices and advice offered in this interdisciplinary article help bridge the gap between the architects and auditors of information systems and show either role how to benefit from an understanding of the other role’s terminology, techniques, and general work approach.

AB  - The UK government took a bruising in the headlines (Sep 2008) after a Home Office contractor lost a USB stick containing unencrypted data on all 84,000 prisoners in England and Wales. As a result, the Home Office terminated the £1.5 million contract with the management consultancy firm.

The world woke up to the largest attempted bank fraud ever when the UK’s National Hi-Tech Crime Unit foiled the world’s largest potential bank robbery in March 2005. With the help of the security supervisor, thieves masquerading as cleaning staff installed hardware keystroke loggers on computers within the London branch of a Japanese bank, to steal £220m.

It is indeed sobering to imagine that any organisation could fall victim to such events and the damage an insider can do. The consulting firm lost the contract worth £1.5 million due to a small mistake by an employee. The London branch of the Japanese Bank would have lost £220 million had not the crime been foiled.

Insider threat is a reality. Insiders commit fraud or steal sensitive information when motivated by money or revenge. Well-meaning employees can compromise the security of an organisation with their overzealousness in getting their job done. Every organisation has a varied mix of employees, consultants, management, partners and complex infrastructure and that makes handling insider threats a daunting challenge. With insider attacks, organisations face potential damage through loss of revenue, loss of reputation, loss of intellectual property or even loss of human life.

The insider threat problem is more elusive and perplexing than any other threat. Assessing the insider threat is the first step to determine the likelihood of any insider attack. Technical solutions do not suffice since insider threats are fundamentally a people issue. Therefore, a three-pronged approach - technological, behavioural and organisational assessment is essential in facilitating the prediction of insider threats and pre-empt any insider attack thus improving the organization’s security, survivability, and resiliency in light of insider threats.

AB  - Now that more and more legal transactions are being performed online, it is increasingly necessary to enable integration of legal mandates within identity and information management systems. The purpose of this article is to outline the legal framework surrounding delegation and to identify basic requirements for any technical application which seeks to provide recognition to legal mandates and delegation processes. Special consideration is also given to the legal implications in situations where a (presumed) mandate holder acts without or outside his authority. Based on these considerations, this article attempts to outline an approach which can significantly reduce the potential risks for both mandate issuers and relying service providers.

AB  - A security certification method is described for a document handling system for a major government organization. The security evaluation process includes identification of the exposures of the system, determination of the controls that cover those exposures, and evaluation of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the controls. Included are the details of the analysis performed and the types of results expected in that analysis, both of which constitute the basic evaluation of the document handling system. The certification analysis approach can be extended naturally to other types of computing systems.

AB  - AbstractPurpose
Data generated in the care of patients are widely used to support clinical research and quality improvement, which has hastened the development of self-service query tools. User interface design for such tools, execution of query activity, and underlying application architecture have not been widely reported, and existing tools reflect a wide heterogeneity of methods and technical frameworks. We describe the design, application architecture, and use of a self-service model for enterprise data delivery within Duke Medicine.
Methods
Our query platform, the Duke Enterprise Data Unified Content Explorer (DEDUCE), supports enhanced data exploration, cohort identification, and data extraction from our enterprise data warehouse (EDW) using a series of modular environments that interact with a central keystone module, Cohort Manager (CM). A data-driven application architecture is implemented through three components: an application data dictionary, the concept of “smart dimensions”, and dynamically-generated user interfaces.
Results
DEDUCE CM allows flexible hierarchies of EDW queries within a grid-like workspace. A cohort “join” functionality allows switching between filters based on criteria occurring within or across patient encounters. To date, 674 users have been trained and activated in DEDUCE, and logon activity shows a steady increase, with variability between months. A comparison of filter conditions and export criteria shows that these activities have different patterns of usage across subject areas.
Conclusions
Organizations with sophisticated EDWs may find that users benefit from development of advanced query functionality, complimentary to the user interfaces and infrastructure used in other well-published models. Driven by its EDW context, the DEDUCE application architecture was also designed to be responsive to source data and to allow modification through alterations in metadata rather than programming, allowing an agile response to source system changes.

AB  - Mobile agent based e-marketplace auction trading requires a secure and auditable system with a solid framework to support it. In investigating the requirements, it transpired that there is a lack of such a standardised framework. While mobility helps in avoiding network latency, particularly in increasing fairness in applications with bounded response times such as trading of auctions, it nevertheless raises issues concerning security, privacy and trust in protecting personal confidential information, managing and regulating legitimate trading and payment processing. These issues are of paramount importance and must be taken into consideration when designing a framework for modelling an auditable e-marketplace for mobile users. This also implies that there is also an underlying need to provide mobile users with simple, transparent and unobtrusive user interface. This paper proposes a framework that accommodates these requirements through protocol scenarios and highlight further research work that need to be performed.

Information is an essential asset for organizations, because it supports the day-today operations, and facilitates decision-making by the organization’s key stakeholders. The challenge facing organizations is how to provide access to this asset without compromising its integrity. This asset is received and distributed by the organization through various distribution channels, which is connected together by the telecommunications network. These channels include:

•
Email
•
Internet
•
Applications (e.g. Financial, Logistics, Retail, Property and Construction, Energy etc.)
•
DBMS (MS SQL Server, Oracle, DB2, Sybase, etc.)

AB  - This paper views the Reference Monitor in a new framework that makes it possible to generalize from passive to active monitors. It describes a major trend in the evolution of information systems security. The concepts are a practical reflection of real-world needs, expressed in a theoretical framework. The approach of employing active and passive policies provides a higher level of security than would otherwise be possible. The passive traditional Reference Monitor that interprets security policies and permits or prohibits access requests is supplemented by an active monitor to initiate behavior, such as taking positive actions to maintain integrity, taking recovery actions to restore situations after failures, and regularly monitoring the system. This extension to enforcement of various policies supports distributed systems architectures as the appropriate model for thinking about information technology (IT) security.

Modern organizations need to develop ‘digital forensic readiness’ to comply with their legal, contractual, regulatory, security and operational obligations. A review of academic and practitioner literature revealed a lack of comprehensive and coherent guidance on how forensic readiness can be achieved. This is compounded by the lack of maturity in the discourse of digital forensics rooted in the informal definitions of key terms and concepts. In this paper we validate and refine a digital forensic readiness framework through a series of expert focus groups. Drawing on the deliberations of experts in the focus groups, we discuss the critical issues facing practitioners in achieving digital forensic readiness.

AB  - Abstract
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) security issues have been a major concern for decades. Today's ICT infrastructure faces sophisticated attacks using combinations of multiple vulnerabilities to penetrate networks with devastating impact. With the recent rise of cloud computing as a new utility computing paradigm, organizations have been considering it as a viable option to outsource major IT services in order to cut costs. Some organizations have opted for a private or hybrid cloud to take advantage of the emerging technologies and services. However, ICT security issues have to be appropriately mitigated. This research proposes a cloud security framework and an approach for vulnerabilities coverage and cost optimization using Cuckoo search algorithm with Lévy flights as random walks. The objective is to mitigate an identified set of vulnerabilities using a selected set of techniques when minimizing cost and maximizing coverage. The results show that Cloud Computing providers and organizations implementing cloud technology within their premises can effectively balance IT security coverage and cost using the proposed approach.

One of the major research challenges for the successful deployment of cloud services is a clear understanding of security and privacy issues on a cloud environment, since cloud architecture has dissimilarities compared to traditional distributed systems. Such differences might introduce new threats and require a different treatment of security and privacy issues. It is therefore important to understand security and privacy within the context of cloud computing and identify relevant security and privacy properties and threats that will support techniques and methodologies aimed to analyze and design secure cloud based systems.

SG is not a single technology; rather it is a combination of different areas of engineering, communication and management. This paper introduces AMI technology and its current status, as the foundation of SG, which is responsible for collecting all the data and information from loads and consumers. AMI is also responsible for implementing control signals and commands to perform necessary control actions as well as Demand Side Management (DSM). In this paper we introduce SG and its features, establish the relation between SG and AMI, explain the three main subsystems of AMI and discuss related security issues.

AB  - Abstract
There is an increased amount of data produced by next generation sequencing (NGS) machines which demand scalable storage and analysis of genomic data. In order to cope with this huge amount of information, many biobanks are interested in cloud computing capabilities such as on-demand elasticity of computing power and storage capacity. There are several security and privacy requirements mandated by personal data protection legislation which hinder biobanks from migrating big data generated by the NGS machines. This paper describes the privacy requirements of platform-as-service BiobankClouds according to the European Data Protection Directive (DPD). It identifies several key privacy threats which leave BiobankClouds vulnerable to an attack. This study benefits health-care application designers in the requirement elicitation cycle when building privacy-preserving BiobankCloud platforms.

Both the United Kingdom and the United States of America have published guidelines for the forensic analysis of mobile devices; these guidelines are examined throughout this paper. In the United Kingdom they are issued by ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers) Good Practice Guide for Computer-Based Electronic Evidence. In the United States of America these are issued by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). Special Publication 800-101, Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics.

AB  - Data breach notification laws require organisations to notify affected persons or regulatory authorities when an unauthorised acquisition of personal data occurs. Most laws provide a safe harbour to this obligation if acquired data has been encrypted. There are three types of safe harbour: an exemption; a rebuttable presumption and factor-based analysis. We demonstrate, using three condition-based scenarios, that the broad formulation of most encryption safe harbours is based on the flawed assumption that encryption is the silver bullet for personal information protection. We then contend that reliance upon an encryption safe harbour should be dependent upon a rigorous and competent risk-based review that is required on a case-by-case basis. Finally, we recommend the use of both an encryption safe harbour and a notification trigger as our preferred choice for a data breach notification regulatory framework.

AB  - Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) increases the reusability of software and hence decreases software development time and cost. Unfortunately, developing components for maximum reusability and acquiring third party components invite many security related concerns. The security related issues are more crucial for embedded and real-time systems. Currently, many approaches are proposed to aid the development and evaluation of secure components. However, it is well known among practitioners that, like any other software entities, components cannot be completely secure. This fact leads us to incorporate intrusion detection facilities to equip components with mechanisms to discover intrusions against components. In this paper, we present a framework for developing components with intrusion detection capabilities. This framework uses UMLintr, a UML profile for intrusion specifications. The profile allows developers to specify intrusion scenarios using UML diagrams. Specifying intrusion scenarios using the same language that is used for specifying software behavior eliminates the need for separate languages for describing intrusions. Other software specification languages can be easily adopted into this framework. The outcome of this framework are components equipped with intrusion detectors. Based on UMLintr, a prototype is built and used to generate signatures for some intrusions included in the benchmark DARPA attack datasets. Furthermore, we describe an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which uses these signatures to detect component intrusions.

AB  - Computer and network security is becoming increasingly important as both large systems and, increasingly small, embedded systems are networked. Middleware frameworks aid the system developer who must interconnect individual systems into larger interconnected, distributed systems. However, there exist very few middleware frameworks that have been designed for use with embedded systems, which constitute the vast majority of CPUs produced each year, and none offer the range of security mechanisms required by the wide range of embedded system applications. This paper describes MicroQoSCORBA, a highly configurable middleware framework for embedded systems, and its security subsystem. It first presents an analysis of security requirements for embedded applications and what can and should be done in middleware. It then presents the design of MicroQoSCORBA’s security subsystem and the wide range of mechanisms it supports. Experimental results for these mechanisms are presented for two different embedded systems and one desktop computer that collectively represent a wide range of computational capabilities.

Using six anomaly-associated risk factors identified from previous studies, the latent class model based on an unlabeled sample yielded acceptable classification results compared with a logistic regression model based on a labeled sample (correctly classified: 0.95 vs. 0.98, sensitivity: 0.99 vs. 0.99, and specificity: 0.77 vs. 0.97). The study demonstrates a great potency for using the latent class modeling technique to analyze network traffic data.

NADIR compares network activity, as summarized in weekly profiles of individual users and the ICN as a whole, against expert rules that define security policy and improper or suspicious behaviour. NADIR reports suspicious behaviour to security auditors and provides tools to aid in follow-up investigations. This paper describes analysis by NADIR of two types of ICN activity: user authentication and access control, and mass file storage. It highlights system design issues of data handling, exploiting existing auditing systems, and performing audit analysis at the network level.

AB  - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks constitute one of the major threats and among the hardest security problems in today’s Internet. Of particular concern are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, whose impact can be proportionally severe. With little or no advance warning, a DDoS attack can easily exhaust the computing and communication resources of its victim within a short period of time. Because of the seriousness of the problem many defense mechanisms have been proposed to combat these attacks. This paper presents a structural approach to the DDoS problem by developing a classification of DDoS attacks and DDoS defense mechanisms. Furthermore, important features of each attack and defense system category are described and advantages and disadvantages of each proposed scheme are outlined. The goal of the paper is to place some order into the existing attack and defense mechanisms, so that a better understanding of DDoS attacks can be achieved and subsequently more efficient and effective algorithms, techniques and procedures to combat these attacks may be developed.

AB  - Abstract
We describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of FROST—three new forensic tools for the OpenStack cloud platform. Our implementation for the OpenStack cloud platform supports an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud and provides trustworthy forensic acquisition of virtual disks, API logs, and guest firewall logs. Unlike traditional acquisition tools, FROST works at the cloud management plane rather than interacting with the operating system inside the guest virtual machines, thereby requiring no trust in the guest machine. We assume trust in the cloud provider, but FROST overcomes non-trivial challenges of remote evidence integrity by storing log data in hash trees and returning evidence with cryptographic hashes. Our tools are user-driven, allowing customers, forensic examiners, and law enforcement to conduct investigations without necessitating interaction with the cloud provider. We demonstrate how FROST's new features enable forensic investigators to obtain forensically-sound data from OpenStack clouds independent of provider interaction. Our preliminary evaluation indicates the ability of our approach to scale in a dynamic cloud environment. The design supports an extensible set of forensic objectives, including the future addition of other data preservation, discovery, real-time monitoring, metrics, auditing, and acquisition capabilities.

AB  - Abstract
A large number of emerging Internet applications require information dissemination across different organizational boundaries, heterogeneous platforms, and a large, dynamic population of publishers and subscribers. A new information-centric network architecture called Network of Information (NetInf) has been developed in the context of the FP7 EU-funded 4WARD project. This architecture can significantly improve large scale information distribution. Furthermore, it supports future mobile networks in situations with intermittent and heterogeneous connectivity and connects the digital with the physical world to enable better user experience. However, NetInf is still in an early stage of implementation and its security is yet to be evaluated. The security concern of NetInf is a major factor for its wide-scale adoption. Therefore, this paper uses the X.805 security standard to analyse the security of the NetInf architecture. The analysis highlights the main source of threats and potential security services to tackle them. The paper also defines a threat model in the form of possible attacks against the NetInf architecture.

AB  - Abstract
Cloud computing is arguably one of the most significant advances in information technology (IT) services today. Several cloud service providers (CSPs) have offered services that have produced various transformative changes in computing activities and presented numerous promising technological and economic opportunities. However, many cloud customers remain reluctant to move their IT needs to the cloud, mainly due to their concerns on cloud security and the threat of the unknown. The CSPs indirectly escalate their concerns by not letting customers see what is behind virtual wall of their clouds that, among others, hinders digital investigations. In addition, jurisdiction, data duplication and multi-tenancy in cloud platform add to the challenge of locating, identifying and separating the suspected or compromised targets for digital forensics. Unfortunately, the existing approaches to evidence collection and recovery in a non-cloud (traditional) system are not practical as they rely on unrestricted access to the relevant system and user data; something that is not available in the cloud due its decentralized data processing. In this paper we systematically survey the forensic challenges in cloud computing and analyze their most recent solutions and developments. In particular, unlike the existing surveys on the topic, we describe the issues in cloud computing using the phases of traditional digital forensics as the base. For each phase of the digital forensic process, we have included a list of challenges and analysis of their possible solutions. Our description helps identifying the differences between the problems and solutions for non-cloud and cloud digital forensics. Further, the presentation is expected to help the investigators better understand the problems in cloud environment. More importantly, the paper also includes most recent development in cloud forensics produced by researchers, National Institute of Standards and Technology and Amazon.

AB  - It is a rather human truth that when we hand out privileges they often get abused. Whether you are operating in the high reaches of government or the most basic market the sad fact is – where we find privilege we also find the abuse of privilege. In the world of IT, privileged accounts are identities that have elevated permission to access potentially sensitive data, run programs or change configuration settings. To put it simply, privileged accounts are the keys to the kingdom of IT.

When we hand out privileges they often get abused. In the world of IT, privileged accounts – identities that have elevated permission to access sensitive data, run programs or change settings – are found on every server, workstation and appliance.

In recent years we have witnessed more and more organisations fail to adequately secure such accounts, with catastrophic results. There are common practices that have lead to a number of security breaches and failed IT compliance audits, some of them very high-profile. Jane Grafton of Lieberman Software looks at the five most common errors with privileged accounts – and how to avoid them.

We describe a data management solution and associated key management approaches to provide accountability within service provision networks, in particular addressing privacy issues in cloud computing applications. Our solution involves machine readable policies that stick to data to define allowed usage and obligations as data travels across multiple parties. Service providers have fine-grained access to specific data based on agreed policies, enforced by interactions with independent third parties that check for policy compliance before releasing decryption keys required for data access. We describe alternative solutions based upon Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Identity Based Encryption (IBE) and advanced secret sharing schemes.

AB  - Economics can be used as a tool to explain, describe, and to a certain extent predict many forms of human behaviour. However, there is only a limited body of work on its application to information security, much of which is acknowledged as partial or incomplete. As a consequence, there is a paucity of robust explanatory or predictive models that are tuned for the peculiarities of the “cyber” challenge, either to organisations, or, at a higher level, the nation state.

The effect of this is that the base arguments for information security business cases are often weak or flawed; as a result, there is an argument that both organisations and nation states will therefore tend to underinvest in information security. To improve this position, there would be benefits for information security, as a profession adopting economic models used in other areas of endeavour that historically have suffered similar problems. One potential model is full-cost accounting.

However, there are a number of further implications. These include an underlining of the importance of information security professional “speaking business language”. Also highlighted is the potential value of building a common knowledge base of the true cost of security failures, akin to the actuarial bodies of knowledge used in the insurance industry, rather than the partial and imperfect measures in use today.

This paper makes an exhaustive survey of various network forensic frameworks proposed till date. A generic process model for network forensics is proposed which is built on various existing models of digital forensics. Definition, categorization and motivation for network forensics are clearly stated. The functionality of various Network Forensic Analysis Tools (NFATs) and network security monitoring tools, available for forensics examiners is discussed. The specific research gaps existing in implementation frameworks, process models and analysis tools are identified and major challenges are highlighted. The significance of this work is that it presents an overview on network forensics covering tools, process models and framework implementations, which will be very much useful for security practitioners and researchers in exploring this upcoming and young discipline.

AB  - Incident Response has always been an important aspect of Information Security but it is often overlooked by security administrators. Responding to an incident is not solely a technical issue but has many management, legal, technical and social aspects that are presented in this paper. We propose a detailed management framework along with a complete structured methodology that contains best practices and recommendations for appropriately handling a security incident. We also present the state-of-the art technology in computer, network and software forensics as well as automated trace-back artifacts, schemas and protocols. Finally, we propose a generic Incident Response process within a corporate environment.

AB  - The entire field of computer forensics must be rethought, believes Justin Peltier. Stone cold, stupid attacks bring down companies as easily as more sophisticated hacks, says Becky Bace. Here are just two of the views of a recent Q&amp;A session with leading infosecurity professionals. An uncertain future is foretold as experts hold vastly different opinions on what threats lie in wait for the industry.

Four security gurus join Richard Power and Dario Forte, this month, to thrash out big future threats and necessary countermeasures. They have vastly different views on what is important with one expert predicting a rise in virtual machine attacks, another in desktop attacks and a third believing cyber attacks will have an increasing influence on physical events.

Peltier believes the whole computer investigation field needs to be rethought due to the emergence of anti-forensics. He also says we have not seen the worst of DDoS attacks yet, and predicts a resurgence. Peltier foretells a rise in the use of CD-based firewalls making firewalls more resistant to threats that exploit configuration.

Infidel CEO Becky Bace believes suppliers watch helplessly as attackers move up the application stack, and fail to keep up with countermeasures. She predicts classic antivirus and worm defences are on their way out to be overtaken by better solutions.

Keith Rhodes of the US General Accountability Office thinks the trend of developers not writing code leads to sloppiness in software.

And independent consultant Rik Farrow is highly sceptical of Microsoft's inroads into the antivirus market.

Richard Power and Dario Forte organize an expert roundtable to answer three big questions about attacks and countermeasures in the past, present and future.

AB  - Public Key Infrastructures have not reached the widespread diffusion expected of them, although they are well understood from a security point of view, because, like many say, the killer application has not been found yet. The lack of a clear understanding of the performance of these systems also contributes significantly to their limited diffusion. Studies have appeared of specific aspects of the operations of PKIs, but no complete studies of the overall system are known.

In this paper we present an evaluation study of X.509-compliant Public Key Infrastructures using queuing network models. We focus our analysis on the performance of the subsystem in charge of generating and managing digital certificates, under a variety of load conditions, both in terms of the type of requests and their number. We also investigate the impact on the performance of the system of some implementation choices such as revocation mechanisms and auditing activities. The main result of our analysis is that the system we consider, given the current state of technology, can guarantee acceptable response time in steady state even in the presence of PKI with a consistent number of users. However, in order to guarantee such a performance level, throughput must not exceed 3.5 requests per second, where a request can be a certificate generation or revocation request. Such a limitation hinders the deployment of PKIs with large numbers of users, since recovering after a system compromise may require an unacceptable amount of time.

AB  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is one of the most important layers of Cloud Computing. However, there is an evident deficiency of mechanisms for analysis, comparison and evaluation of IaaS cloud implementations, since no unified taxonomy or reference architecture is available. In this article, we propose a unified taxonomy and an IaaS architectural framework. The taxonomy is structured around seven layers: core service layer, support layer, value-added services, control layer, management layer, security layer and resource abstraction. We survey various IaaS systems and map them onto our taxonomy to evaluate the classification. We then introduce an IaaS architectural framework that relies on the unified taxonomy. We provide a detailed description of each layer and define dependencies between the layers and components. Finally, we evaluate the proposed IaaS architectural framework on several real-world projects, while performing a comprehensive analysis of the most important commercial and open-source IaaS products. The evaluation results show notable distinction of feature support and capabilities between commercial and open-source IaaS platforms, significant deficiency of important architectural components in terms of fulfilling true promise of infrastructure clouds, and real-world usability of the proposed taxonomy and architectural framework.

AB  - Delegation, from a technical point of view, is widely considered as a potential approach in addressing the problem of providing dynamic access control decisions in activities with a high level of collaboration, either within a single security domain or across multiple security domains. Although delegation continues to attract significant attention from the research community, presently, there is no published work that presents a taxonomy of delegation concepts and models. This article intends to address this gap by presenting a set of taxonomic criteria relevant to the concept of delegation. This article also applies the taxonomy to a selection of significant delegation models published in the literature.

AB  - Communication and Information Systems (CIS) now form the primary information store, exchange and data analysis for all modern military and are crucial to command and control. The ubiquitousness of CIS within the military not only means that there is a complete reliance on CIS, but also presents new avenues of attack by malicious insiders. Military sources say that the insider threat is their number one security concern. This paper presents a case study of the technical counter measures and processes used to deter, detect and mitigate malicious insider threats that the author has researched, using non-classified anonymous interview and the analysis of anonymised qualitative field data, within a specific military organisation. It is not the intention of the author that this paper be viewed as an analysis of the “current state of play” of threats and countermeasures that generically exist across all military and defence organisations – rather it presents the technological and organisational processes utilised and challenges encountered at one organisation. A short discussion of the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) structure adopted to successfully manage insider and other CIS security threats is presented, followed by a more detailed overview of existing and emerging technical efforts to deter, detect and mitigate such malicious insider threats within the military environment under study. Emphasis will be on the emerging technologies such as anomaly detection using real-time e-discovery, enterprise forensics and profiling users “cyber” behaviour and how these integrate into CSIRT technologies and processes. The technical advantages and challenges that such technologies present within a military alliance will be discussed. The success of such technologies in combating current malicious insider threat environment will be briefly compared with those put forward as challenges in the “Research on mitigating the insider threat to information systems #2” workgroup which took place in 2000 (Anderson et al., 2000.). In closing the author introduce the concept of Stateful Object Use Consequence Analysis as a way of managing the insider threat.

AB  - A fundamental requirement for the healthcare industry is that the delivery of care comes first and nothing should interfere with it. As a consequence, the access control mechanisms used in healthcare to regulate and restrict the disclosure of data are often bypassed in case of emergencies. This phenomenon, called “break the glass”, is a common pattern in healthcare organizations and, though quite useful and mandatory in emergency situations, from a security perspective, it represents a serious system weakness. Malicious users, in fact, can abuse the system by exploiting the break the glass principle to gain unauthorized privileges and accesses.

In this paper, we propose an access control solution aimed at better regulating break the glass exceptions that occur in healthcare systems. Our solution is based on the definition of different policy spaces, a language, and a composition algebra to regulate access to patient data and to balance the rigorous nature of traditional access control systems with the “delivery of care comes first” principle.

Computer simulation is finding a role in an increasing number of scientific disciplines, concomitant with the rise in available computing power. Marshalling this power facilitates new, more effective and different research than has been hitherto possible. Realizing this inevitably requires access to computational power beyond the desktop, making use of clusters, supercomputers, data repositories, networks and distributed aggregations of these resources. The use of diverse e-infrastructure brings with it the ability to perform distributed multiscale simulations. Accessing one such resource entails a number of usability and security problems; when multiple geographically distributed resources are involved, the difficulty is compounded. In this paper we present a solution, the Application Hosting Environment,33

 which provides a Software as a Service layer on top of distributed e-infrastructure resources. We describe the performance and usability enhancements present in AHE version 3, and show how these have led to a high performance, easy to use gateway for computational scientists working in diverse application domains, from computational physics and chemistry, materials science to biology and biomedicine.

AB  - Wireless handheld technology provides new ways to deliver and present information. As with any technology, its unique features must be taken into consideration and its applications designed accordingly. In the clinical setting, availability of needed information can be crucial during the decision-making process. Preliminary studies performed at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) determined that there are inadequate access to information and ineffective communication among clinicians (potential proximal causes of medical errors). In response to these findings, the authors have been developing extensions to their Web-based clinical information system including PalmCIS, an application that provides access to needed patient information via a wireless personal digital assistant (PDA). The focus was on achieving end-to-end security and developing a highly usable system. This report discusses the motivation behind PalmCIS, design and development of the system, and future directions.

AB  - Over the years, we have created an information infrastructure, with most of us connected but nobody totally responsible, which is easily targeted for attacks by adversaries. A series of deadly viruses and denial-of-service attacks are warnings of the fragile state of information security. Information warfare (IW) is a serious concern as it has no border and operates in a different realm. This paper articulates how IW can devastatingly attack the critical information infrastructure. Two aspects of IW are considered, viz., Defensive IW and Offensive IW. Currently, security solutions lag far behind the potential threats. Loosely coupled defenders cannot avert the damage caused by orchestrated coordinated attacks. Society is locked up in a vicious circle of wits and resources. This situation is likely to continue and we need to be proactive and make progress on a rocky path. It is time we got battle space ready. Without the coordinated efforts of government, disparate groups and organisations, society is one click away from grave danger of exploitation and dominance.

This paper is primarily written for auditors who are becoming involved in auditing computerized accounting systems. It covers in detail general controls in computer systems, the first and most important category of controls evaluated by an auditor. General controls relate to all EDP activities; they span all jobs processed on the computer system. When they are weak or non-existing, the auditor must expand his testing of the entire computer system, often at considerable additional cost to the client.

AB  - For some location-based applications, such as emergency calling or roadside assistance, it appears that the identity of the requester is less important than accurate and trustworthy location information for accomplishing the main function. Accurate and genuine location is important for these applications to avoid misuse.

In this paper we point to some ongoing efforts regarding transition emergency service architectures that could introduce security vulnerabilities unless countermeasures are developed. Furthermore, we summarize the ongoing work in providing cryptographic assertions for location.

We argue that many of the currently proposed ideas are difficult to deploy and to operate. Additionally, when used without ensuring that the underlying assumptions are met these mechanisms do not provide any additional benefit, but costs.

We conclude this article with a suggestion on what the research community and industry should be investigating to avoid potential problems with IP-based emergency services.

AB  - One of the current challenges regarding distance learning systems, from a performance point of view, is the efficient and timely delivery of multimedia-enriched learning materials. Providing guaranteed Class of Service (CoS) and Quality of Service (QoS) are also challenging especially for remote sites and rural areas where Internet coverage tends to be limited. On a different note, another challenge is to track the audience accessing the learning materials and more importantly to monitor the true identity of the examination attendees. This paper aims to investigate both of these issues simultaneously, with an introduction of a non-repudiation system that provides a security mechanism, as well as maintaining certain QoS measures. This system not only authenticates the intended party, but also integrates a digital signature scheme accompanied with the transmitted multimedia-based information. The included digital signature prevents a later dispute from the involved parties that the communication ever took place or they ever took part in the communication.

Therefore this paper introduces and discusses a multimedia-enriched interactive non-repudiation system involved in a mobile-based learning (m-learning) environment. The performance of this system is considered and discussed in terms of network-centric parameters, including end-to-end delays, overhead, and bandwidth, using Labview 8.5 mobile-transmitter and mobile-receiver testbeds.

AB  - Increasing interest in and use of cloud computing services presents both opportunities for criminal exploitation and challenges for law enforcement agencies (LEAs). For example, it is becoming easier for criminals to store incriminating files in the cloud computing environment but it may be extremely difficult for LEAs to seize these files as the latter could potentially be stored overseas. Two of the most widely used and accepted forensic frameworks – McKemmish (1999) and NIST (Kent et al., 2006) – are then reviewed to identify the required changes to current forensic practices needed to successfully conduct cloud computing investigations. We propose an integrated (iterative) conceptual digital forensic framework (based on McKemmish and NIST), which emphasises the differences in the preservation of forensic data and the collection of cloud computing data for forensic purposes. Cloud computing digital forensic issues are discussed within the context of this framework. Finally suggestions for future research are made to further examine this field and provide a library of digital forensic methodologies for the various cloud platforms and deployment models.

AB  - Nowadays, the increase of interdependencies among different Critical Infrastructures (CI) makes it more and more difficult to protect without using a systemic approach that considers a single infrastructure as part of a complex system of infrastructures. A strong collaboration among CI owners is required to avoid, or at least to limit the propagation of failures from one infrastructure to another and to put CI in safety mode. The key element enabling this required cooperation is the possibility for them to exchange relevant information related to the status of their infrastructures and to the services provided. In this paper, we present a middleware solution that allows CIs sharing real-time information, enabling the design and implementation of fault mitigation strategies and mechanisms to prevent the cascading phenomena generated by the failure propagation from one infrastructure to another.

AB  - Cloud storage services such as the popular Microsoft© SkyDrive© provide both organisational and individual users a cost-effective, and in some cases free, way of accessing, storing and disseminating data. The identification of digital evidence relating to cloud storage services can, however, be a challenge in a digital forensic investigation. Using SkyDrive as a case study, we identified the types of terrestrial artefacts that are likely to remain on a client’s machine (in the context of our experiments; computer hard drive and iPhone), and where the access point(s) for digital forensics examiners are, that will allow them to undertake steps to secure evidence in a timely fashion.

AB  - Trust has been defined in many ways, but at its core it involves acting without the knowledge needed to act. Trust in records depends on four types of knowledge about the creator or custodian of the records: reputation, past performance, competence, and the assurance of confidence in future performance. For over half a century society has been developing and adopting new computer technologies for business and communications in both the public and private realm. Frameworks for establishing trust have developed as technology has progressed. Today, individuals and organizations are increasingly saving and accessing records in cloud computing infrastructures, where we cannot assess our trust in records solely on the four types of knowledge used in the past. Drawing on research conducted at the University of British Columbia into the nature of digital records and their trustworthiness, this article presents the conceptual archival and digital forensic frameworks of trust in records and data, and explores the common law legal framework within which questions of trust in documentary evidence are being tested. Issues and challenges specific to cloud computing are introduced.

AB  - Abstract
The proliferation of smartphones introduces new opportunities in digital forensics. One of the reasons is that smartphones are usually equipped with sensors (e.g. accelerometer, proximity sensor, etc.), hardware which can be used to infer the user's context. This context may be useful in a digital investigation, as it can aid in the rejection or acceptance of an alibi, or even reveal a suspect's actions or activities. Nonetheless, sensor data are volatile, thus are not available in post-mortem analysis. Thus, the only way to timely acquire them, in case such a need arises during a digital investigation, is by software that collects them when they are generated by the suspect's actions. In this paper we examine the feasibility of ad-hoc data acquisition from smartphone sensors by implementing a device agent for their collection in Android, as well as a protocol for their transfer. Then, we discuss our experience regarding the data collection of smartphone sensors, as well as legal and ethical issues that arise from their collection. Finally, we describe scenarios regarding the agent's preparation and use in a digital investigation.

AB  - Abstract
Cloud storage is an emerging challenge to digital forensic examiners. The services are increasingly used by consumers, business, and government, and can potentially store large amounts of data. The retrieval of digital evidence from cloud storage services (particularly from offshore providers) can be a challenge in a digital forensic investigation, due to virtualisation, lack of knowledge on location of digital evidence, privacy issues, and legal or jurisdictional boundaries. Google Drive is a popular service, providing users a cost-effective, and in some cases free, ability to access, store, collaborate, and disseminate data. Using Google Drive as a case study, artefacts were identified that are likely to remain after the use of cloud storage, in the context of the experiments, on a computer hard drive and Apple iPhone3G, and the potential access point(s) for digital forensics examiners to secure evidence.

This article surveys these challenges and explicates an approach to designing and prototyping an evaluation framework for decisions based on image inspection. The framework explored here allows users to analyze storage and computational costs of information gathering as a function of information granularity and then assesses the potential value of decision process reconstructions. We illustrate how evaluations of decision process reconstructions could potentially improve our understanding of future archival needs by simultaneously documenting, preserving and reconstructing computer-assisted decision processes, and evaluating and forecasting computational and storage requirements of the documentation and reconstruction processes over time.

AB  - The authors contend that the emerging ubiquitous Information Society (aka ambient intelligence, pervasive computing, ubiquitous networking and so on) will raise many privacy and trust issues that are context dependent. These issues will pose many challenges for policy-makers and stakeholders because people's notions of privacy and trust are different and shifting. People's attitudes towards privacy and protecting their personal data can vary significantly according to differing circumstances. In addition, notions of privacy and trust are changing over time. The authors provide numerous examples of the challenges facing policy-makers and identify some possible responses, but they see a need for improvements in the policy-making process in order to deal more effectively with varying contexts. They also identify some useful policy-making tools. They conclude that the broad brush policies of the past are not likely to be adequate to deal with the new challenges and that we are probably entering an era that will require development of “micro-policies”. While the new technologies will pose many challenges, perhaps the biggest challenge of all will be to ensure coherence of these micro-policies.

AB  - Abstract
Gossip-based protocols have proven very efficient for disseminating high-bandwidth content such as video streams in a peer-to-peer fashion. However, for the protocols to work, nodes are required to collaborate by devoting a fraction of their upload bandwidth, a scarce resource for some of them, to forward the content they receive to other nodes. Consequently, such protocols suffer from freeriding, a common phenomenon on the Internet, which consists in selfishly benefiting from the system without contributing its fair share. Due to the dynamic nature and the inherent randomness of gossip protocols and to the high scalability requirements of video streaming systems, detecting freeriders is a difficult challenge.

This paper presents LiFTinG, the first protocol for detecting freeriders, including colluding ones, in gossip-based content dissemination systems with asymmetric data exchanges. In addition, LiFTinG is still able to detect freeriders when network coding, a widely used technique to improve the efficiency of content dissemination, is used. LiFTinG relies on nodes to track abnormal behavior by cross-checking the history of their previous interactions and exploits the fact that nodes pick neighbors at random to prevent colluding nodes from mutually covering up their bad actions.

We present a methodology for setting the parameters of LiFTinG to their optimal value, based on a theoretical analysis and we quantify theoretically the performance of LiFTinG. We derive, based on simulations, the optimal strategy of freeriders by taking into account, through a utility function, the benefit of freeriding and the probability of being detected. In addition to these simulations, we report on the deployment of LiFTinG on PlanetLab. In a 300-node system, where a stream of 674 kbps is broadcasted, LiFTinG incurs a maximum overhead of only 8% and provides good detection results: For instance, with 10% of freeriders decreasing their contribution by up to 30%, LiFTinG detects 86% of the freeriders after only 30 s and wrongfully expels only a few honest nodes (most of them actually being buggy).

Internet technologies are beginning to influence the sale and supply of illicit drugs in Australia. One such technology, an online marketplace known as Silk Road, had dramatically increased in popularity since its worldwide launch in February 2011. This research and paper were completed prior to the Silk Road's founder, Ross Ulbricht being arrested on 2 October 2013 and Silk Road being taken off line. This research paper will consider such factors; as the increasing use of internet by Australians, the popularity of shopping online and the variance in the quality and price of products available on Silk Road to those available in other drug markets. The case study will provide an in-depth look at Silk Road from an Australian perspective and in light of the continuing popularity of illicit drug use in Australia. Though Silk Road is currently off line, ‘Bitcoin’ has survived and it will only be a matter of time before a substitute for Silk Road emerges.

AB  - Abstract
Privacy policies are rules designed to ensure that individuals’ health data are properly protected. Health Information Systems (HIS) are legally required to adhere to these policies. Since privacy policies are imposed on complex software systems, it is extremely hard to reason about their conformance and consistency. In order to address this problem, we have created a model-driven authoring environment to formally specify privacy policies originally defined in legal terms. In our observation, appropriate formalization of our policy language enabled formal analysis of its policies; these features were key to a successful model-driven engineering process. In this paper we present our modeling language and show its semantic anchoring to analyzable logic programs. We report on several projects where our approach is being applied and validated.

AB  - There is a critical gap in our nation’s ability to accurately measure and manage the quality of medical care. A robust healthcare quality information system (HQIS) has the potential to address this deficiency through the capture, codification, and analysis of information about patient treatments and related outcomes. Because non-technical issues often present the greatest challenges, this paper provides an overview of these socio-technical issues in building a successful HQIS, including the human, organizational, and knowledge management (KM) perspectives. Through an extensive literature review and direct experience in building a practical HQIS (the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Outcomes Research Database system), we have formulated an “informatics blueprint” to guide the development of such systems. While the blueprint was developed to facilitate healthcare quality information collection, management, analysis, and reporting, the concepts and advice provided may be extensible to the development of other types of clinical research information systems.

AB  - Dispute of transactions is a common problem that could jeopardise business. Hence non-repudiation services are essential in business transactions which provide evidence to enable dispute resolution. To be eligible as non-repudiation evidence, the digital signature on an electronic document should remain valid until its expiry date which is specified by some non-repudiation policy. The conventional approaches are either inefficient or insecure to achieve non-repudiation in electronic commerce. This article presents a practical scheme to secure digital signatures as non-repudiation evidence with an adjustable degree of risk.

AB  - Secure access to patient data and analysis tools to run on that data will revolutionize the treatment of a wide range of diseases, by using advanced simulation techniques to underpin the clinical decision making process. To achieve these goals, suitable e-Science infrastructures are required to allow clinicians and researchers to trivially access data and launch simulations. In this paper we describe the open source Individualized MEdiciNe Simulation Environment (IMENSE), which provides a platform to securely manage clinical data, and to perform wide ranging analysis on that data, ultimately with the intention of enhancing clinical decision making with direct impact on patient health care. We motivate the design decisions taken in the development of the IMENSE system by considering the needs of researchers in the ContraCancrum project, which provides a paradigmatic case in which clinicians and researchers require coordinated access to data and simulation tools. We show how the modular nature of the IMENSE system makes it applicable to a wide range of biomedical computing scenarios, from within a single hospital to major international research projects.

AB  - Advanced mobile devices such as laptops and smartphones make convenient hiding places for surveillance spyware. They commonly have a microphone and camera built-in, are increasingly network accessible, frequently within close proximity of their users, and almost always lack mechanisms designed to prevent unauthorized microphone or camera access.

In order to explore surveillance intrusion and detection methods, we present a modernized version of a microphone hijacker for Windows and Mac OS X. The Windows attack can be executed as soon as the target connects to the Internet from anywhere in the world without requiring interaction from victimized users and the Mac OS X attack involves a trojaned installation routine. As the attacker compromises additional machines they are organized into a botnet so the attacker can maintain stealthy control of the systems and launch later surveillance attacks.

We then use the attack to show how common elements of microphone hijacker programs can be used against them. From there we present a mechanism to detect the threat on Windows, as well as a novel method to deceive an attacker in order to permit traceback. As a result of the detection mechanism we address a missing segment of resource control, decreasing the complexity of privacy concerns as exploitable devices become more pervasive.

AB  - The changes imposed by new information technologies, especially pervasive computing and the Internet, require a deep reflection on the fundamental values underlying privacy and the best way to achieve their protection. The explicit consent of the data subject, which is a cornerstone of most data protection regulations, is a typical example of requirement which is very difficult to put into practice in the new world of “pervasive computing” where many data communications necessarily occur without the users' notice. In this paper, we argue that an architecture based on “Privacy Agents” can make privacy rights protection more effective, provided however that this architecture meets a number of legal requirements to ensure the validity of consent delivered through such Privacy Agents. We first present a legal analysis of consent considering successively (1) its nature; (2) its essential features (qualities and defects) and (3) its formal requirements. Then we draw the lessons of this legal analysis for the design of a valid architecture based on Privacy Agents. To conclude, we suggest an implementation of this architecture proposed in a multidisciplinary project involving lawyers and computer scientists.

AB  - National and international telecommunication infrastructures have been set up through Europe to facilitate the movement of information. One major benefactor of the improved communication infrastructures is the health care community. The accessibility and interoperability of medical information systems is one of the grand challenges for the 21st century. Within Europe current developments in the application of telemedicine are being defined in separate initiatives. There are a number of pilot actions concentrating on various aspects of telemedicine. These actions involving the introduction of new technology or working practices rarely fail for technology related problems. However, in order to fully assess the likely take-up of telemedical technologies it is vital that all the aspects including non-technical are also addressed.

This paper describes how a complete pilot telemedical information society will be set up which facilitates to support secure and standardised remote diagnosis, teleconsultations and advanced medical facilities in a number of sectors covering a crucial spectrum of those required to support a complete telemedical information society. This pilot testbed will then be assessed in the context of a European environment identifying a business plan for its extension to other member states therefore promoting a truly international telemedical information society for the 21st century.
