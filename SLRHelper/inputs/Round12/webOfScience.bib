Abstract = {{Trustworthy system logs and application logs are crucial for digital
   forensics. Researchers have proposed different security mechanisms to
   ensure the integrity and confidentiality of logs. However, applying
   current secure logging schemes on heterogeneous formats of logs is
   tedious. Here, we propose Forensics Aware Language (FAL), a
   domain-specific language (DSL) through which we can apply a secure
   logging mechanism on any format of logs. Using FAL, we can define log
   structure, which represents the format of logs and ensures the security
   properties of a chosen secure logging scheme. This log structure can
   later be used by FAL to serve two purposes: it can be used to store
   system logs securely and it will help application developers for secure
   application logging by generating the required source code.}},

Abstract = {{Forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify
   suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to
   form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability
   to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past
   two decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed
   information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to
   improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that
   transparently monitors and records data access events within a
   virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the
   hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and
   follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after
   the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these
   transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for
   faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the
   changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we
   provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case
   study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable
   information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been
   detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking
   mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple
   disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.}},

Abstract = {{Logging information about the activities that placed in a computer is
   essential for understanding its behavior. In Homeland Security, the
   reliability of the computers used in their activities is of paramount
   importance. However, attackers can delete logs to hide evidence of their
   activities. Additionally, various problems may result in logs being
   lost. These problems decrease the dependability of Homeland Security. To
   address these problems, we previously proposed a secure logging scheme
   using a virtual machine monitor (VMM). The scheme collects logs and
   isolates them from the monitored OS. However, the scheme cannot store
   them automatically. Thus, logs in memory are lost when the computer is
   shutdown. Further, if the logs are not stored, it is impossible to
   detect incidents of tampering by comparing the logs of the monitored OS
   with those of the logging OS. To address these additional problems, this
   paper proposes a log-storing module and a tamper detection scheme. The
   log-storing module automatically stores logs collected by the logging
   module, and tamper detection is realized by comparing these stored log
   files with those of the monitored OS. We implemented the log-storing
   module and realized the tamper detection scheme. Evaluations reveal the
   effectiveness of the tamper detection scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Audit logs are an integral part of modern computer systems due to their
   forensic value. Protecting audit logs on a physically unprotected
   machine in hostile environments is a challenging task, especially in the
   presence of active adversaries. It is critical for such a system to have
   forward security and append-only properties such that when an adversary
   compromises a logging machine, she cannot forge or selectively delete
   the log entries accumulated before the compromise. Existing
   public-key-based secure logging schemes are computationally costly.
   Existing symmetric secure logging schemes are not publicly verifiable
   and open to certain attacks.
   In this article, we develop a new forward-secure and aggregate signature
   scheme called Blind-Aggregate-Forward (BAF), which is suitable for
   secure logging in resource-constrained systems. BAF is the only
   cryptographic secure logging scheme that can produce publicly
   verifiable, forward-secure and aggregate signatures with low
   computation, key/signature storage, and signature communication
   overheads for the loggers, without requiring any online trusted third
   party support. A simple variant of BAF also allows a fine-grained
   verification of log entries without compromising the security or
   computational efficiency of BAF. We prove that our schemes are secure in
   Random Oracle Model (ROM). We also show that they are significantly more
   efficient than all the previous publicly verifiable cryptographic secure
   logging schemes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a security model that applies the reference monitor
   concept in trusted operating systems to end-user applications, to

   application like user identification and authentication, access control,
   secure communications, accountability and audit, audit log analysis and
   intrusion detection. The security reference monitor is a single point
   through which all access requests to the application are validated. This
   paper presents ESRM as applied to a File Transfer application. Rules
   have been configured to comprehensively validate all input data and
   enforce user access control. Application data has been logged for
   statistical analysis of usage patterns; to monitor the effectiveness of
   the present rules and to obtain data needed to update present rule base
