AB  - Trustworthy system logs and application logs are crucial for digital forensics. Researchers have proposed different security mechanisms to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of logs. However, applying current secure logging schemes on heterogeneous formats of logs is tedious. Here, we propose FAL, a domain-specific language (DSL) through which we can apply a secure logging mechanism on any format of logs. Using FAL, we can define log structure, which represents the format of logs and ensures the security properties of a chosen secure logging scheme. This log structure can be later used by FAL to serve two purposes: it can be used to store system logs securely, and it will help application developers for secure application logging by generating required source code.

AB  - Audit logs, providing information about the current and past states of systems, are one of the most important parts of modern computer systems. Providing security for audit logs on an untrusted machine in a large distributed system is a challenging task, especially in the presence of active adversaries. In such a system, it is critical to have forward security such that when an adversary compromises a machine, she cannot modify or forge the log entries accumulated before the compromise. Unfortunately, existing secure audit logging schemes have significant limitations that make them impractical for real-life applications: existing public key cryptography (PKC) based schemes are computationally expensive for logging in task intensive or resource-constrained systems, while existing symmetric schemes are not publicly verifiable and incur significant storage and communication overheads. In this paper, we propose a novel forward secure and aggregate logging scheme called blind-aggregate-forward (BAF) logging scheme, which is suitable for large distributed systems. BAF can produce publicly verifiable forward secure and aggregate signatures with near-zero computational, storage, and communication costs for the loggers, without requiring any online trusted third party (TTP) support. We prove that BAF is secure under appropriate computational assumptions, and demonstrate that BAF is significantly more efficient and scalable than the previous schemes. Therefore, BAF is an ideal solution for secure logging in both task intensive and resource-constrained systems.

AB  - The rise of many kinds of grid systems, and associated security threats, makes very necessary the provision of trustworthy services for audit and logging. However, existing solutions tend to put little emphasis on the security of logging. We present a number of use cases where the logs have security properties in their own rights, and so the logs themselves are highly privileged: hence, these need to be integrity and confidentiality protected while being generated, accessed, reconciled and analysed with distributed services spanning across multiple administrative domains. We derive a common set of secure logging requirements to address the security gaps which exist between these use cases and existing solutions.From the requirements, we propose a novel logging architecture for the grid based on virtual machine (VM) isolation and trusted computing capabilities: a small number of privileged driver VMs trigger all trusted logging requests and forward them to the secure logging service running within the log security manager. The logging service verifies the integrity of the log data and the security configurations of these driver VMs (log generators) before storing the logs.

AB  - With the spectacular increase in online activities like e-transactions, security and privacy issues are at the peak with respect to their significance. Large numbers of database security breaches are occurring at a very high rate on daily basis. So, there is a crucial need in the field of database forensics to make several redundant copies of sensitive data found in database server artifacts, audit logs, cache, table storage etc. for analysis purposes. Large volume of metadata is available in database infrastructure for investigation purposes but most of the effort lies in the retrieval and analysis of that information from computing systems. Thus, in this paper we mainly focus on the significance of metadata in database forensics. We proposed a system here to perform forensics analysis of database by generating its metadata file independent of the DBMS system used. We also aim to generate the digital evidence against criminals for presenting it in the court of law in the form of who, when, why, what, how and where did the fraudulent transaction occur. Thus, we are presenting a system to detect major database attacks as well as anti-forensics attacks by developing an open source database forensics tool. Eventually, we are pointing out the challenges in the field of forensics and how these challenges can be used as opportunities to stimulate the areas of database forensics.

AB  - Forensic analysis of software log files is used to extract user behavior profiles, detect fraud, and check compliance with policies and regulations. Software systems maintain several types of log files for different purposes. For example, a system may maintain logs for debugging, monitoring application performance, and/or tracking user access to system resources. The objective of my research is to develop and validate a minimum set of log file attributes and software security metrics for user nonrepudiation by measuring the degree to which a given audit log file captures the data necessary to allow for meaningful forensic analysis of user behavior within the software system. For a log to enable user nonrepudiation, the log file must record certain data fields, such as a unique user identifier. The log must also record relevant user activity, such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting system resources, as well as software security events, such as the addition or revocation of user privileges. Using a grounded theory method, I propose a methodology for observing the current state of activity logging mechanisms in healthcare, education, and finance, then I quantify differences between activity logs and logs not specifically intended to capture user activity. I will then propose software security metrics for quantifying the forensic-ability of log files. I will evaluate my work with empirical analysis by comparing the performance of my metrics on several types of log files, including both activity logs and logs not directly intended to record user activity. My research will help software developers strengthen user activity logs for facilitating forensic analysis for user nonrepudiation.

AB  - Network forensics is a new approach for the network security, because the firewall and IDS cannot always stop and discover the misuse in the network. Once the system is compromised, the forensics and investigation always after the attacks and lose some useful instant evidence. The integrated analysis of the log and audit system and network traffic can lead to an efficient navigation of the traffic. The current network forensics approaches only focus on the network traffic capture and traffic replay, which always result in the performance bottleneck or forensics analysis difficulties. However, the adaptive capture without lose the potential sensitive traffic and real time investigation are seldom discussed. In this paper, we discuss the frameworks of distributed agent-based real time network intrusion forensics system, which is deployed in local area network environment. Some novel approaches for network forensics are discussed for the first time, such as network forensics server, network forensics database, network forensics agents, forensics data integration and active real time network forensic.

AB  - Summary form only given. Logs generated by operating systems and application programs provide important information to a network administrator. Logs are used for various purposes including security management, audit, and forensics of intranet. To use logs for such purposes, it is important that logs are reliably retrieved from hosts in the intranet. But the syslog protocol which is widely used for network logging does not meet this requirement. Thus, the use of TCP for improving the reliability is being standardized at the IETF. However, TCP is not effective for providing the reliability in terms of cost and delay. In this paper, we examine the issues and requirements of network logging based on experiments in a real network environment and point out problems of TCP. Then we propose an efficient mechanism for the reliable delivery of syslog messages and validate its effectiveness thorough NS-2 simulations.

AB  - In this paper we propose comprehensive security architecture called VICTOR to deal with different types of attacks on virtual machines. Our model takes into account the specific characteristics of operating system and applications running in each virtual machine (VM) at a fine granular level to deal with the attacks. Our architecture has several components such as entity validation, intrusion detection engine and dynamic analyzer. The entity validation component is used in the detection of attack traffic with spoofed source address, secure logging, and capturing information of the operating system and applications running in the virtual machines. The intrusion detection engine component is used for detection of known attacks and suspicious behaviour by monitoring the incoming and outgoing traffic of virtual machines. The dynamic analyzer is used for detection and validation of suspicious processes, detection of zero day attacks and fine granular isolation of malicious process or application that is generating the attack traffic.

AB  - With the tremendous growth of the Internet, information system security has become an issue of serious global concern due to the rapid connection and accessibility. Developing effective methods for intrusion detection, therefore, is an urgent task for assuring computer & information system security. Since most attacks and misuses can be recognized through the examination of system audit log files and pattern analysis therein, an approach for intrusion detection can be built on them. First we have made deep analysis on attacks and misuses patterns in log files; and then proposed an approach using support vector machines for anomaly detection. It is a one-class SVM based approach, trained with abstracted user audit logs data from 1999 DARPA.

It automatically generates rules from historical data and, in terms of those rules, identifies computer transactions that are at variance with historically established usage patterns. Issues addressed include how W&amp;S generates rules from a necessarily small sample of all possible transactions, how W&amp;S deals with inherently categorical data, and how W&amp;S assists system security officers in their review of audit logs. Preliminary results with W&amp;S show that the software does periodically detect anomalies of high interest even in data though to be free of such events

AB  - This paper presents an overview of requirements and standards development activities for securing the control and management infrastructure protocols for optical networking protocols used in the Global Information Grid-Bandwidth Expansion (GIG-BE). Our approaches to hardening these protocols are: (1) to develop open standards that encompass the Department of Defense's needs; and (2) to encourage vendors to supply products that support these standards and other appropriate security functionality for GIG-BE signaling, routing, discovery, and management. At MILCOM 2001, Buda et al. reported on commercial-off-the-shelf security standards being developed for the GIG; they covered asynchronous transfer mode, multi-protocol label switching, and newly emerging optical networking. We have now completed control plane security and management plane security implementation agreements at the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF), coordinated and aligned these with ATIS-T1M1 and the IETF, and begun efforts to implement and demonstrate these agreements. This paper briefly describes the OIF's work on control plane functionality in optical networks and the security requirements for these control protocols. It then explains why additional security was required for signaling, routing, and discovery; shows what alternatives were considered; and describes the choices made in the OIF's Security Extension for UNI and NNI. Securing an optical switch depends on much more than secure control protocols, so the paper next covers the OIF's Security for Management Interfaces to Transport Network Elements, which describes security objectives and choices for securing operations, administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM and P) interfaces to these network elements. Specifications and recommendations are given along with a mapping of how following the specifications satisfies the initial objectives. The relationship of this work to the security standards developed by T1M1 is also described. Beyond these two implementation agreements, on-going efforts are focused on demonstrating the practicality of this approach, addressing end-to-end security, adding an audit log capability, continuing cooperation with T1M1 on OAM and P security, and keeping these im- plementation agreements aligned with new drafts and RFC on signaling, routing, discovery, and security at the IETF.

AB  - With the widespread use of information, variety of security logs have increased greatly, which due need for security log management. Organizations requirements have imposed to collect, store, and analyze tremendous volumes of log data across entire infrastructure for extended durations and at increasingly granular levels. It is the process of generating, transmitting, storing, analyzing, and disposing security log data from network to databases. Due to the wide variety of logs, storing comprises different methods. Recorded events in collection module are processed, normalized and classified. Logs are stored in storage module in order to use in forensic, reviewing, auditing and providing further necessities of correlation module. Routine log correlation analysis is beneficial for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activities, troubleshooting and operational network problems. So log management is an important and efficient activity in network monitoring. Finding an effective log management functional architecture for network events analysis is the main goal of this paper. In this paper, we aim to suggest log management architecture with more common functions that are used by vendors. By studying logging architectures the main functions are administration of log collection, normalizing, categorization, queuing prioritizing and storing logged events/alarms by sensors. Log functions are different but the suitable architecture must justify the functions to send a normative, synchronized and prioritized log in an efficient way. The mentioned functions are gathered from SIEM products characteristics. Suggested architecture includes functions and activities in log collection server and storage server.

AB  - There are constant occurrences of Internet security problems due to its rapid development. It is important to maintain Internet security system during and after the occurrences to collect evidence and forensics essences by various devices, such as hard disk, system log, firewall, IDS log, processes, as well as Internet connections. It would be even more beneficial to the forensic process if evidence could be established and kept well before such an incident happened. Most government organizations lack sufficient knowledge of security system techniques and they still believe that this technical part of the work belongs to the police. In fact, we cannot guarantee a perfect stage, but at least we can figure out what the problem is and trace where the attack is from, and that is the mission of computer forensics. Schools or institutes that are engaged in research and development of relative security system techniques are doing their own work; thus, capabilities of computer forensics have been dispersed. Therefore, in order to enhance the forensic skill of information and communication security and ability, what we really need is a complete plan so as to integrate the forensic skill of information and communication security and ability.

AB  - Today's growing number of security threats to computers and networks also increase the importance of log inspections to support the detection of possible breaches. The investigation and assessment of security incidents becomes more and more a daily business. Further, the manual log analysis is essentially in the context of developing signatures for intrusion detection systems (IDS), which allow for an automated defense against security attacks or incidents. But the analysis of log data in the context of fo-rensic investigations and IDS signature development is a tedious and time-consuming task, due to the large amount of textual data. Moreover, this task requires a skilled knowledge to differentiate between the important and the non-relevant information. In this paper, we propose an approach for log resp. audit data representation, which aims at simplifying the analysis process for the security officer. For this purpose audit data and existing relations between audit events are represented graphically in a three-dimensional space. We describe a general approach for analyzing and exploring audit or log data in the context of this presentation paradigm. Further, we introduce our tool, which implements this approach and demonstrate the strengths and benefits of this presentation and exploration form.

AB  - A time-based inductive learning approach to security audit trail analysis is presented. The approach uses a time-based inductive engine to generate rule-based sequential patterns that characterize the behavior of a user. The time-based inductive approach substantially increases the discriminating capability of an anomaly detection system due to the added dimension of information given in the sequential relationships between security events. It is shown that the use of rule-based sequential patterns allows a security auditing system to capture characteristics of user behavior that may be otherwise intractable using traditional statistical approaches. The approach also may help security management to focus on a few potentially hostile security events inside an entire user log-in session

AB  - A formal model of security monitoring that distinguishes two different methods of recording information (logging) and two different methods of analyzing information (auditing) is presented. From this model, implications for the design and use of security monitoring mechanisms are drawn. The model is then applied to security mechanisms for statistical databases, monitoring mechanisms for computer systems, and backups, in order to demonstrate its usefulness. It is concluded that the proposed model of logging and auditing is comprehensive enough to encompass very different schemes used in a variety of contexts. For example. Statistical database query control and file access monitoring systems do not seem to be related, and yet they create closely related security problems, and the mechanisms designed to improve the security of one will also improve the security of the other

AB  - Security, especially security compliance, is a major concern that is slowing down large scale adoption of cloud computing in the enterprise environment. Governmental regulations, business requirements and trust are among the reasons why enterprises require certain levels of security compliance from cloud providers. So far, security compliance or auditing information has been generated manually by security specialists. This involves manual data collection and assessment, which is slow and expensive. Thus, there is a need for an automated security compliance tool (ASCT) to verify and express the compliance of various cloud providers. Such a tool can reduce the human intervention and eventually reduce the cost and time by verifying the compliance automatically. Also, the tool will enable transparency of the cloud vendors to the customers which in turn will help grow confidence on the cloud vendors. Having these goals in mind, we have developed an architecture to build an ASCT for a cloud computing platform. We have also outlined four possible approaches to achieve this automation. These possible four approaches refer to four data collection mechanisms to collect data from the cloud systems and these are: API, vulnerability scanning, log analysis and manual entry. Finally, we have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype of this ASCT based on the proposed architecture. The prototype is integrated with OpenStack cloud platform and the results are exposed using the CloudAudit API.

AB  - In this paper, we define SIEM and we discuss Android security monitoring as well as recent research in Android security systems. Then, we propose a cloud based security system for collection, visualization, analysis and correlation of application logs, statistics and determining abnormal application and network behavior on the device. If abnormal behavior is detected an appropriate alert is sent back to the device for remedial action. In the case of abnormal network traffic, then firewall rules to be updated on an implementation of an IPTABLES/ NETFILTER firewall to block unwarranted network traffic. Furthermore a web interface is created to enable visualization of logs and all data collected from the device. So it serves as an intrusion mitigation solution coupled with security information audit web portal. This paper highlights the architecture of the proposed system.

AB  - Log files are primary source of information for identifying the System threats and problems that occur in the System at any point of time. These threats and problem in the system can be identified by analyzing the log file and finding the patterns for possible suspicious behavior. The concern administrator can then be provided with appropriate alter or warning regarding these security threats and problems in the system, which are generated after the log files are analyzed. Based upon this alters or warnings the administrator can take appropriate actions. Many tools or approaches are available for this purpose, some are proprietary and some are open source. This paper presents a new approach which uses a MapReduce algorithm for the purpose of log file analysis, providing appropriate security alerts or warning. The results of this system can then be compared with the tools available.

AB  - In today's IT environments, there is an ever increasing demand for log file analysis solutions. Log files often contain important information about possible incidents, but inspecting the often large amounts of textual data is too time-consuming and tedious a task to perform manually. To address this issue, we propose a novel log file visualization technique called Histogram Matrix (HMAT). HMAT visualizes the content of a log file in order to enable a security administrator to efficiently spot anomalies. The system uses a combination of graphical and statistical techniques and allows even non-experts to interactively search for anomalous log messages. Contrary to other approaches, our proposal does not only work on certain special kinds of log files, but instead works on almost every textual log file. Additionally, the system allows to automatically generate security events if an anomaly is detected, similar to anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. This paper introduces HMAT, demonstrates its functionality using log files from a variety of services in real environments, and identifies strengths and limitations of the technique.

AB  - Recent security lapses within the Department of Energy Laboratories prompted the establishment and implementation of additional procedures and training for operations involving classified removable electronic media (CREM) storage. In addition, the definition of CREM has been expanded and the number of CREM has increased significantly. Procedures now require that all CREM be inventoried and accounted for on a weekly basis. Weekly inventories consist of a physical comparison of each item against the reportable inventory listing. Securing and accounting for CREM is a continuous challenge for existing security systems. To address the challenge, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has developed an automated electronic media security system (EMSS) for a weekly CREM inventory collection and reporting system. The EMSS approach is to tag the CREM with an electronically readable unique identification code and automatically collect data on the inventory in each security container or vault at a user-defined interval and upon detection of an access event, thus eliminating the need for hand-written inventory sheets while allowing automated transfer of the collected inventory data to an electronic reporting system. An electronic log of CREM access events is maintained, providing enhanced accountability for daily/weekly checks, routine audits, and follow-up investigations. The key attributes of the EMSS include improved accountability, reduced risk of human error, improved accuracy and timeliness of inventory data, and reduced costs as a result of man-hour reductions.

AB  - Database audit can strengthen the security of database. Logging database activities is usually the first step of implementing database audit. In this paper, we present a logging scheme for database audit. Unlike native database logging and auditing mechanism, our scheme is to monitor and log database activities through analyzing network traffic. The architecture of our scheme contains three principal components: packets capturing, packets parsing and data storage. First capture the packets to and from the database; then, by analyzing database communication protocols, parse the captured packets; finally, use the parsed results to support database audit.

AB  - With the increasing acceptance of cloud data center and virtualization technology by enterprises and industries, the security concern becomes the key hindrance to the development and deployment of cloud computing. Security auditing is a good way to deal with the threats faced by a cloud data center. But traditional auditing is no longer suitable for the new cloud environment. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate the CDCAS, a novel cloud data center auditing system, which matches the demand of the scalability and efficiency of a cloud data center. In this system, we design one distributed and autonomous agent model which can be controlled by a set of rules dynamically generated to fit its use scenario. We then build the log analysis model which uses the signature based method and correlative analysis algorithm to extract security events from collected log with agreeable false positives. We evaluate our system both on real world and simulation to validate its efficiency. And our system is also deployed by the cloud data center of a well-known financial institution, and performs well.

AB  - Logging and auditing is an important system facility for monitoring correct system operation and for detecting potential security problems. We present an architecture for implementing user-level auditing monitors which: (i) does not require superuser privileges; (ii) makes it simple to create user defined monitors which are transparent; and (iii) provides security guarantees such as mandatory and reliable monitoring while maintaining confidentiality of setuid processes. We avoid problems of self-referential monitoring. Monitor use policies can be specified to increase flexibility. We show that our framework can be tailored so that it is very efficient with low overhead on macro and micro benchmarks. This demonstrates that it is feasible to make use of arbitrary and programmable user-level monitors for system security and auditing applications

AB  - Database auditing can help strengthen the security of database. In this paper, we present a framework of database auditing, which log the database activities through analyzing network traffic, execute audit analysis through event correlation and generate alarms if an anomaly or a violation of security regulations is detected. Compared with native auditing mechanism in database, our approach has an obvious advantage of providing zero-impact to the performance of the database or the applications that access it. In addition, using third-party auditing component complies with the principle of separation of duties.

AB  - The phenomenal increase in the amounts of network security data are due to the hacker attacks, virus, worm and Slapper etc. Network security log databases are very important in intrusion detection and computer forensics. A lot of data mining methods to research it have been found. Fast and accurate retrievals for content-based queries are crucial for such numerous database systems to be useful. In this paper, a new method is provided to analyze and mine this kind of time-serial database. After signalize the NSD databases, we first represent a DWT wavelet transform analysis algorithm, then present two wavelet-based algorithms GET&#095;INDICES and QUERY for querying the complex and numerous NSD, and finally give the experimental result using these algorithms.

AB  - Digital forensics encompasses the process of identifying the perpetrator and the criminal method by analyzing the logs generated in the computer. Log files record the activities of the computer and by reading them one can know what kind of event happened at a certain time. Therefore, secure logs with the integrity property are essential. In this paper, we discuss two approaches to achieve the integrity of logs- the kernel module and virtualization, and compare them. Although virtualization is more inefficient in performance than the kernel module, it provides more security properties for logs. Thus, we then focus on the virtualization approach with a detailed proposal, which describes ways to preserve logs without tampering and deletion.

AB  - This paper presents a solution that simultaneously addresses both reliability and security (RnS) in a monitoring framework. We identify the commonalities between reliability and security to guide the design of Hyper Tap, a hyper visor-level framework that efficiently supports both types of monitoring in virtualization environments. In Hyper Tap, the logging of system events and states is common across monitors and constitutes the core of the framework. The audit phase of each monitor is implemented and operated independently. In addition, Hyper Tap relies on hardware invariants to provide a strongly isolated root of trust. Hyper Tap uses active monitoring, which can be adapted to enforce a wide spectrum of RnS policies. We validate Hyper Tap by introducing three example monitors: Guest OS Hang Detection (GOSHD), Hidden Root Kit Detection (HRKD), and Privilege Escalation Detection (PED). Our experiments with fault injection and real root kits/exploits demonstrate that Hyper Tap provides robust monitoring with low performance overhead.

AB  - The responsibility of providing cost-effective, elastic and on-demand access to computing and storage resources lies with the Cloud Service Providers. As for the end-user, it provides an abstraction of reliable and infinite resource availability. Infinite resource availability is based on virtualization technology and availability of a shared pool of computational and storage resources. It is this very nature of the cloud - of being a black box to the end user - that is posing a threat to its faster adoption and growth in the market. Several issues have been raised on the aspects of legal, security and compliance requirements in the public cloud. Legal issues concern with the applicable laws according to the physical location of data. Regulatory issues such as provision of log files provided by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for audits. Security issues are concerned with the safety of cloud environment against any form of security attacks. Other major concerns include, but are not limited to - availability, recovery and privacy. Identifying measures and control mechanisms to address and resolve such issues could help in standardizing the Cloud environment from the Cloud Service Provider's end. This paper explores the major issues identified in the Private cloud and the existing control mechanisms.

AB  - Log management is essential to register the three-dimensional spatial data. It plays the role of auditing and monitoring in the system. The traditional method of log management is to set up a management module which records the users' manipulations respectively for each function. Though it's easy to apply such a management system, it consumes more time and energy. Another method is only to use the triggers to record the users' operations. But if this method is adopted, the information would be lost before the triggers were created manually. Thus it's necessary to design an efficient system to improve this situation. This log management designed in this paper introduces the stored procedures and triggers to design a log system to store and manage the three-dimensional spatial data. The stored procedure is used to create triggers and Oracle database tables which are applied for recording information. Triggers would be fired when users do anything to the records stored in the Oracle database tables. It also sets the switches to disable and enable triggers timely to release resources. All the tables and triggers are created dynamically by procedures. Once users created a user account on the Oracle database, the system would create all tables and triggers by calling the procedure which written in the system package. It can save a lot of time for the user and record all the operations in case users damage the data before the tables were created. Oracle database records the concrete operations, including operate-times, operate-types, Ips, usernames, etc. And the log files of this system are designed especially for recording each detail of the operations. The administrator is able to do the recovery operation according to the log management system. So it is essential to use the log management system to insure the safety of the three-dimensional spatial data. This system cuts down the programmers' workload for writing duplicate codes. It is not only an improvement to th- - e Oracle database application performance for the three-dimensional spatial data management and the developer productivity, but also a consolidation to the three-dimensional spatial data management security.

Since the main question which influence the clustering algorithm application in the log analysis is uneasy to determine the network attack type and the cluster number, so we bring forward an optimized cluster algorithm to solve this problem. By means of simulated experiments, this algorithm is proved feasible, efficient and extensible for unknown intrusion detection.

AB  - Computer security breaches are already a major problem in using computers. The most basic defense against it is to monitor and audit the computer logs. Computer logs, however have a huge amount of textual data. It is, therefore, almost impossible to inspect them manually using current systems. We propose a log visualization system called "Tudumi". Tudumi consists of several functions which assist system administrators to perform such tasks manually. These functions are information visualization, log summarization and reflecting known rules into the visualization method. Tudumi makes it easier to detect anomalous user activities, such as intrusion, from a huge amount of computer logs.

AB  - Auditable file system is used to track the usage of the file system including the operations like read and write. Auditable file system keeps the trails of userspsila action and the trails are kept faithfully for future auditing. However, as the logs are still kept within the same file system, it will be quite vulnerable to be exposed as malware penetrating the system. Even with the file system hiding the logs, the skillful attacker can still analyze the on-disk structure to get and modify the logs. Thus the logs should be kept separate from the working system. Virtual machines can provide such separation as virtual machines can hold the whole operating system while still keep the system apart from the metal hardware. We propose a method of secure logging for auditable file system using a logging virtual machine. The logs are kept in another virtual machine safely. Even the working virtual machine is broken; the logs are not exposed to the outside. By the isolation provided by virtual machines, the logs can be kept safe and valid. The high privileged user can not modify the logs contents, or forge the logs and data to keep consistency, or pretend to be another user for doing un-authorized actions. We have done several works as well as a prototype system to show the feasibility of such approach. Experiments show that the logging virtual machine will not bring too much overhead.

AB  - Different users apply computer forensic systems, models, and terminology in very different ways. They often make incompatible assumptions and reach different conclusions about the validity and accuracy of the methods they use to log, audit, and present forensic data. This is problematic, because these fields are related, and results from one can be meaningful to the others. We present several forensic systems and discuss situations in which they produce valid and accurate conclusions and also situations in which their accuracy is suspect. We also present forensic models and discuss areas in which they are useful and areas in which they could be augmented. Finally, we present some recommendations about how computer scientists, forensic practitioners, lawyers, and judges could build more complete models of forensics that take into account appropriate legal details and lead to scientifically valid forensic analysis.

AB  - Cloud computing plays an important role in web .The term cloud computing is based on internet computing. Cloud computing is a service to perform tasks through internet. It provides large scale of resource to each user using virtual machine. Cloud computing is easily threatened by the users because all users are not trustworthy. This is the first problem. The second problem in cloud computing is number of users can use the service but it makes the admin to analyze the log. In this paper ,we propose the multilevel intrusion detection system and log audit for detecting the attacks and maintain the security level and effectiveness of the system. The intrusion detection system is based on data mining techniques and anomaly detection method.

AB  - Auditing is a key part of the security infrastructure in a database system. While commercial database systems provide mechanisms such as triggers that can be used to track and log any changes made to &#x201C;sensitive&#x201D; data using UPDATE queries, they are not useful for tracking accesses to sensitive data using complex SQL queries, which is important for many applications given recent laws such as HIPAA. In this paper, we propose the notion of SELECT triggers that extends triggers to work for SELECT queries in order to facilitate data auditing. We discuss the challenges in integrating SELECT triggers in a database system including specification, semantics as well as efficient implementation techniques. We have prototyped our framework in a commercial database system and present an experimental evaluation of our framework using the TPC-H benchmark.

AB  - Current Web browsers are plagued with vulnerabilities, providing hackers with easy access to computer systems via browser-based attacks. Browser security efforts that retrofit existing browsers have had limited success because the design of modern browsers is fundamentally flawed. To enable more secure web browsing, we design and implement a new browser, called the OP Web browser, that attempts to improve the state-of-the-art in browser security. Our overall design approach is to combine operating system design principles with formal methods to design a more secure Web browser by drawing on the expertise of both communities. Our overall design philosophy is to partition the browser into smaller subsystems and make all communication between subsystems simple and explicit. At the core of our design is a small browser kernel that manages the browser subsystems and interposes on all communications between them to enforce our new browser security features. To show the utility of our browser architecture, we design and implement three novel security features. First, we develop novel and flexible security policies that allows us to include plugins within our security framework. Our policy removes the burden of security from plugin writers, and gives plugins the flexibility to use innovative network architectures to deliver content while still maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of our browser, even if attackers compromise the plugin. Second, we use formal methods to prove that the address bar displayed within our browser user interface always shows the correct address for the current Web page. Third, we design and implement a browser-level information-flow tracking system to enable post-mortem analysis of browser-based attacks. If an attacker is able to compromise our browser, we highlight the subset of total activity that is causally related to the attack, thus allowing users and system administrators to determine easily which Web site lead to the compromise and- to assess the damage of a successful attack. To evaluate our design, we implemented OP and tested both performance and filesystem impact. To test performance, we measure latency to verify OP's performance penalty from security features are be minimal from a users perspective. Our experiments show that on average the speed of the OP browser is comparable to Firefox and the audit log occupies around 80 KB per page on average.

AB  - Cloud data provenance, or "what has happened to my data in the cloud", is a critical data security component which addresses pressing data accountability and data governance issues in cloud computing systems. In this paper, we present Progger (Provenance Logger), a kernel-space logger which potentially empowers all cloud stakeholders to trace their data. Logging from the kernel space empowers security analysts to collect provenance from the lowest possible atomic data actions, and enables several higher-level tools to be built for effective end-to-end tracking of data provenance. Within the last few years, there has been an increasing number of proposed kernel space provenance tools but they faced several critical data security and integrity problems. Some of these prior tools' limitations include (1) the inability to provide log tamper-evidence and prevention of fake/manual entries, (2) accurate and granular timestamp synchronisation across several machines, (3) log space requirements and growth, and (4) the efficient logging of root usage of the system. Progger has resolved all these critical issues, and as such, provides high assurance of data security and data activity audit. With this in mind, the paper will discuss these elements of high-assurance cloud data provenance, describe the design of Progger and its efficiency, and present compelling results which paves the way for Progger being a foundation tool used for data activity tracking across all cloud systems.

AB  - The Enterprise File Sync and Share (EFSS) is one of the most important services to provide enterprises' employees with cloud file sync, share, and collaboration services. To take enterprises' concerns into account, such as security, privacy, compliance, and regulation, the existing EFSS solutions are either using private (on-premise) or hybrid cloud service model to provide their services. They usually emphasize that files stored in the solutions are encrypted on transfer and at rest and events occurred in the service are logged as the audit trail. However, support of data encryption and audit trail are not capable of protecting enterprise sensitive data from not well addressed security issues of the EFSS service. The security issues, including employee privacy protection, management of share links and synchronized cloud files, and the secure enterprise directory integration, are pointed out in this article. To address these issues, this work proposes and develops a scalable Secure EFSS service which can be deployed on the on-premise Open Stack cloud infrastructure to securely provide employees with EFSS service. Designs of an integrated security approach are introduced in this article, including data and metadata isolations, Distinct Share Link utility, encryption key management for personal and shared files, sandbox-based cloud file synchronization, and out-of-band authentication method.

AB  - Cloud computing enables the use of Internet services as - needed basis. An important issue in the cloud is assuring privacy for the data stored in the cloud. There is a great challenge in providing security for the data shared in cloud and also prevent leakage of confidential data. To overcome this problem we introduce a novel approach with more secured CIA framework. We introduce auditing mechanisms and for providing trust for cloud users. Logs are maintained and sent periodically to the data owner. To provide security for the data file we encode the file using Base64 algorithm. This paper discusses key challenges in achieving privacy and trust based cloud through the use of secured detecting mechanisms which monitors the actions in cloud via technical and policy-based approaches.

A report is produced for audit log purposes to help decrease the security weaknesses. In Internet security, no hacking tool is more celebrated than the scanner. The scanner is a program that automatically detects security weaknesses in a remote or local host. It might reveal certain inherent weakness within the target host. The primary attributes of the scanner includes the capability to find a machine or network, the capability to find out what services are being run on the host, and the capability to test those services for known holes.

AB  - Identifying the sources of an attack is an important task in the Internet security area. An attack could consist of a large number of packet streams generated by many compromised slaves that consume resources associated with various network elements to deny normal services or a few offending packets to disable a system. Several techniques based on probabilistic samples of transit packets have been developed, to determine the sources of large packet flows. It seems that logging of packet digests is necessary for traceback of an individual packet. A clever technique based on Bloom filters has recently been proposed to generate the audit trails for each individual packet within the network. The scheme is effective. However, the storage requirement is approximately 0.5% of the link capacity, which becomes a problem as link capacity increases. In this paper, we propose packet digesting schemes for flows and sets of packets sharing the same source and destination addresses. Compared with the individual packet digesting scheme, these schemes can achieve similar goals and are much more scalable. Simulations with real Internet traffic show that the storage requirements of our proposed schemes are one to two orders of magnitude lower.

AB  - On-the-fly keyboard user authorization is certainly an interesting option for standard security procedures for high-security computer systems. Unauthorized access to logged-in workstation could threaten the security of data and systems. Conventional authorization methods (passwords, fingerprint scans) verify user identity only during logging process, leaving system vulnerable to user replacement afterwards. Procedures overcoming this peril are often invasive (constant visual monitoring) or uncomfortable (frequent identity verification with user cooperation). A possible solution for constant authorization without these drawbacks is to identify the keyboard user while typing. The approach we propose is based on two extracted keystrokes features: 'flight' and 'dwell'. We have tested the suggested solutions on individual group resembling a medium-sized company. The obtained results are promising.

AB  - A new way to increase the security of data transmission of mobile ad hoc networks [MANETS] is presented in this work. There is a massive increase in using MANETS for unmanned army system for both surveillance and future combat operations. This has necessitated the development of innovative MANET solutions catering to the reliability, security and scalability needs of the defense communications environment [15]. Security and reliability are crucial aspects of MANET, especially in security sensitive applications like military. Secure Message Transmission SMT[1] protocol secure the data transmission phase by tailoring an end-to-end secure data forwarding protocol to the MANET communication requirements and increases the reliability through transmitting the messages in multiple paths with minimal redundancy. This work increases the through the removal of Byzantine Faults [8] in the multiple paths. A binary search probing technique which is resilient to Byzantine failures caused by individual or colluding nodes is incorporated in the SMT protocol to provide more secured transmission. The fault detection algorithm bounds logarithmically (log n -n the number of nodes in the path), so the delay is reduced drastically. The simulated implementation of the work in NS2 shows the marginal increase in the throughput. The delay and jitter variants can also be improved if the nodes location can be predicted. Predicting the nodes location and reducing the unnecessary traffic with the aid of Spatial and Temporal mining is the second phase of this work.

AB  - One of the challenges facing system e-government security professionals is the laborious task of sifting through numerous log files in an attempt to identify malicious traffic and conduct a forensics analysis to determine an appropriate course of action. This process is complicated significantly by the volume of traffic that can be associated with a production system environment. A honeynet can provide a mechanism to identify much of the forensically interesting traffic by creating a representative system to collect traffic data. However, it is challenging to maintain an accurate representation of a dynamic system in order to consistently collect the appropriate data of interest. This research effort addresses a current challenge identified by researchers at the Honeynet Project by describing a methodology for automatically creating and dynamically updating a honeynet in order to facilitate IDS support.

AB  - Network and host Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have become a standard component in security infrastructures. As the action of intrusion represents variable, complicated, and uncertainty characteristic, they face so many problems to resolve for intrusion detection. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. We propose a hybrid IDS, which combines network and host IDS, with anomaly and misuse detection mode, utilizes auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and applies data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. We use an association rule to track all relevant data dependency rule sets for different access roles using a hierarchical structure. We identify malicious transactions from the transaction logs in the database using the data dependency rule sets. These rule sets are continuously updated and stored in a repository. The optimized algorithm actually improves the performance of IDS. Our approach is shown to reduce data access bottlenecks, and ensures minimal manual intervention for maintaining a secure database.

AB  - Due to the tremendous growth of the Internet and Network based services, the severity of network based computer attacks have significantly increased. Thus, IDS play a vital role in network security. Intrusion detection system tries to detect computer attacks by examining various data records, log audits etc. Many existing IDS such as Snort are signature based system. The problem with such a system is that it cannot detect novel attacks whose signature is not available and hence generates a high rate of alerts. In this paper Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Back-Propagation algorithm is used to classify attacks. We train and test MLP with KDD99 training dataset. We use KDD99 dataset which is a subset of the DARPA dataset. It is a preprocessed dataset and is most suitable for our system. We analyze the working of MLP by performing various experiments. We observed that MLP Neural network requires large training time. Once it trained, detects known as well as unknown attacks and also reduces false alerts.

AB  - Collaborative information systems (CISs) are deployed within a diverse array of environments that manage sensitive information. Current security mechanisms detect insider threats, but they are ill-suited to monitor systems in which users function in dynamic teams. In this paper, we introduce the community anomaly detection system (CADS), an unsupervised learning framework to detect insider threats based on the access logs of collaborative environments. The framework is based on the observation that typical CIS users tend to form community structures based on the subjects accessed (e.g., patients' records viewed by healthcare providers). CADS consists of two components: 1) relational pattern extraction, which derives community structures and 2) anomaly prediction, which leverages a statistical model to determine when users have sufficiently deviated from communities. We further extend CADS into MetaCADS to account for the semantics of subjects (e.g., patients' diagnoses). To empirically evaluate the framework, we perform an assessment with three months of access logs from a real electronic health record (EHR) system in a large medical center. The results illustrate our models exhibit significant performance gains over state-of-the-art competitors. When the number of illicit users is low, MetaCADS is the best model, but as the number grows, commonly accessed semantics lead to hiding in a crowd, such that CADS is more prudent.

AB  - Recently it became a hot topic to protect VMs from a compromised or even malicious hypervisor. However, most previous systems are vulnerable to rollback attack, since it is hard to distinguish from normal suspend/resume and migration operations that an IaaS platform usually offers. Some of the previous systems simply disable these features to defend rollback attack, while others heavily need user involvement. In this paper, we propose a new solution to make a balance between security and functionality. By securely logging all the suspend/resume and migration operation inside a small trusted computing base, a user can audit the log to check malicious rollback and constrain the operations on the VMs. The solution considers several practical issues including hardware limitations and minimizing user's interaction, and has been implemented on a recent VM protection system.

AB  - A method is described that takes into account the investments done in the security and/or achieved security confidence in planning new security measures. The method uses new integral security metrics and the well-known graded security model. A precondition for the application of this method is the availability of expert knowledge or statistical data for the model in use that describes a class of situations where the analyzed security situation belongs to. For a number of situations at present, this information has been extracted from standards of graded security. For specific military communications applications the data must be collected from a log analysis of characteristic attacks and security reports, as well as by the traditional knowledge acquisition means.

AB  - In order to realize the full rang of information security, a variety of network equipment, safe equipment have been applied to deal with all aspects of information security and protection by many enterprise. These devices, systems produce a lot of security event log in the network security protection, and these event log data format are different, and different safety equipment may generate the same alerts logs, not only resulting in generating redundant events, but not conducive to the next work of network security situational awareness. Therefore, this paper proposed a method by using the multi-agent technology to collect and analysis the log data generated by network devices and security devices, and then generating a fixed-format data structure and building the log collection and analysis systems to facilitate the later maintenance and use of data.

AB  - The messages generated by the security devices represent the necessary data for the detection of the malicious activities in an information system. The heterogeneity of the devices and the lack of a standard for the security messages make the automatic processing of the messages difficult. The messages are short, use a very wide vocabulary and have different formats. We propose in this article the collaboration between classifiers to increase the accuracy of the classification. We apply the text categorization technics for the automatic classification of security log files messages, in categories defined by an ontology. We develop an extraction module for the message attributes to reduce the vocabulary size. Then we apply two training algorithms: the k-nearest neighbour algorithm and the naive Bayes, on two corpus of security log messages. Finally we propose to collaborate the classifiers to produce a single classifier with better accuracy.

AB  - The tasks of security engineers include detecting attacks and responding to them. In order to accomplish this, a security engineer must be able to decide what behavior indicates an attack and then search for this behavior. Current security visualization tools provide rich and concise visualizations of network data that allow security engineers to determine the nature of attacks on the network. However, current security visualizations lack the ability for security engineers to search for these behaviors in the network logs. The process of finding interesting patterns in the data is called discovery, and finding instances of these patterns is called searching. Security engineers must do both discovery and search, but current security visualization tools only help in discovery. In this paper, we describe the modifications we have made to our security visualization tool, NVisionIP, that allow security engineers to not only discover patterns in the data, but also to search for those patterns in other data.

AB  - Today, there is a huge amount of security services that can be used to implement different security requirements in Web Service based systems. For example, identity management services are required for authentication and authorization whereas message logging services are necessary to achieve non-repudiation. However, the deployment and configuration of these security services usually requires expert knowledge about the systems and expert knowledge about security requirements and implementations which a person can only learn by experience. Furthermore, today's Web Service based systems become increasingly complex. Thus, implementing security requirements is a complex and error prone task, even for experts. For this paper, we analysed several service-based implementations for identity management and their differences in the service orchestration. We present an approach to derive the needed security services, their configuration, and their connections to the functional services, based on defined security requirements for a Web Service based system. Therefore, we evaluate the UML use case model of the system and apply service security pattern derived during the analysis of the identity management implementations.

This deficiency is addressed by the Quickdraw application, which is a passive security log generator for controllers. Quickdraw monitors communication like a network IDS, detects events that should be logged in a controller, creates the security events, and then sends the event to a historian, SEM or other log aggregator.

AB  - As security monitoring grows both more complicated and more sophisticated, there is an increased demand for outsourcing these tasks to managed security service providers (MSSPs). However, the core problem of sharing private security logs creates a barrier to the widespread adoption of this business model. In this paper we analyze the logs used for security analysis with the concern of privacy and propose the constraints on anonymization of security monitor logs. We believe if the anonymization solution fulfills the constraints, MSSPs can detect the attacks efficiently and protect privacy simultaneously

AB  - The network log file database is important to security management. But, with the development of Internet, it has become too bulkiness to be used directly. In this paper, the wavelet decomposition is adopted to mining the useful rules from the network security data. This is different from traditional data mining methods of association rules. Multi-resolution analysis of wavelet transform method is used to analyze and mine the data of network security log file database on different time scale. The period law of the attack number in different time domain is found by this method. These are important messages for taking relevant measures to insure network security.

AB  - Security policies are a key component in protecting enterprise networks. There are many defensive options available to these policies, but current mechanically-enforced security policies are limited to traditional admission-based access control. There are defensive capabilities available that include logging, firewalls, honeypots, rollback/recovery, and intrusion detection systems, but policy enforcement is essentially limited to allow/deny semantics. Furthermore, access-control mechanisms operate independently on each service, which often leads to inconsistent or incorrect application of the intended system-wide policy. To begin to solve these problems, we propose a new system for defense-in-depth using global security policies. Under a global security policy, every policy decision is made with near-global knowledge, and re-evaluated as global knowledge changes, given an initial configuration provided by the administrator. Using a variety of actuators, we make the full array of defensive capabilities available to the global policy. We outline our proposal for enterprise-wide security policies, explore the design space, and discuss Arachne, our prototype implementation.

AB  - Log files are the history books of a computer system. In particular, they tell a good portion of the security related events and menaces that a system has to withstand and, sometimes, fails to resist to. Therefore, log files' analysis can be valuable to system and security administrators if the difficulty of extracting the relevant information of the different kinds of data and formats can be surmounted. And if we consider a huge system in terms of users, services and accesses, the difficulty of the analysis task rises enormously. In infra-structures where there is more than one server and communication link, it is possible for the administrator and security team to configure all systems to record their logs in a central huge repository, but the search for abnormalities is quite impossible without specialized tools. As we believe that the collected information on log files can be valuable, we use information retrieval open source tools to index the log files' fields and search for patterns of suspected behavior, which may indicate a system intrusion. Our development allows queries based on variables introduced by the analyst. The preliminary results obtained when using log files from an academic institution indicates that our approach is effective and can be used as a security aid.

AB  - Security Information Fusion System has recently become one of the major topics in the research area of information security. A great deal of security devices and components have been deployed in network information systems. While improving the systems security performance, they produced lots of redundant or unreliable information. Through the technologies of alert fusion and correlation analysis, alert redundancy can be decreased, administration pressure can be reduced and alert accuracy can be raised effectively. We propose the system architecture of multi-source security information fusion (MS<sup>2</sup>IFS), and discuss the design ideas and algorithm implementation of MS<sup>2</sup>IFS key modules. The results of testing on offline alert logs and online simulated attack data proved the feasibility and validity of MS<sup>2</sup>IFS system and satisfied the design requirement, presenting preferable.

AB  - In this article, we look at the potential relationship between the cost of IT security breaches and port-scan records - specifically, we postulate that the irregular movement of port-scan records is quite similar to stock exchange price dynamics, which have been partially satisfied with stochastic movement and Poisson arrival processing. By intuition, stochastic process methodology can emulate an enterprise's information IT security situation. Our proposed generic approach provides a reasonable procedure to estimate and evaluate IT security risk through data mining of port-scan logs

AB  - Some heterogeneous security equipments such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-virus gateways, can produce massive security events which are difficult to manage efficiently. So a log-based mining, distributed, and multi-protocol supported framework of security monitoring system is proposed. This paper describes the architecture of the information security monitoring system, and focuses on the research of the correlation analysis engine, describes the process that the detection model is built using data mining techniques. Security event correlation based on data mining analysis can automatically extract association rules, analyze alarming and found new invasion model, so it is a highly intelligent solution.

AB  - Cloud computing signifies a paradigm shift from owning computing systems to buying computing services. As a result of this paradigm shift, many key concerns such as the transparency of data transfer and access within the cloud, and the lack of clarity in data ownership were surfaced. To address these concerns, we propose a new way of approaching traditional security and trust problems: To adopt a detective, data-centric thinking instead of the classical preventive, system-centric thinking. While classical preventive approaches are useful, they play a catch-up game; often do not address the problems (i.e. data accountability, data retention, etc) directly. In this paper, we propose a data-centric, detective approach to increase trust and security of data in the cloud. Our framework, known as TrustCloud, contains a suite of techniques that address cloud security, trust and accountability from a detective approach at all levels of granularity. TrustCloud also extends detective techniques to policies and regulations governing IT systems.

AB  - For the VAST 2011 Network Security Mini-Challenge, we adopted geovisual analytic methods and applied them in the field of network security. We used the GeoViz Toolkit [1] to represent cyber security events, by fabricating a simple &#x201C;geography&#x201D; of several sets of blocks (one for the workstations, one for the servers, and one for the Internet) using ArcGIS 10 (by ESRI - Environmental System Research Institute). Security data was tabulated using Perl scripts to parse the logs in order to create representations of event frequency and where they occurred on the network. The tabulated security data was then added as attributes of the geography. Exploration of the data and subsequent analysis of the meaning and impact of the cyber security events was made possible using the GeoViz Toolkit.

AB  - As advancement of information society, information leakages grow into a serious problem. It is important for security managers to analysis log-files for finding out cause of leakages promptly. Existing methods of presenting log-files take the method of ordering them in time. It makes easy to understand a flow of operations. However, if a log recording an incorrect operation is included in the back of log-file, finding out it may drop back. To address this problem, this paper presents visualization system for log analysis with probabilities of incorrect operation. Incorrect operations are operations that may cause a security incident. Probabilities of incorrect operation are set up by rate of number of incorrect operations in past log-files. Security analysts set order of priority, and logs are sorted. Also, we introduce Visualize Part to help security analysts understand a flow of operations in spite of not ordering logs in time. We aim to contribute speedy security analyses by combine visualizing log-file with probabilities of incorrect operation. To evaluate our proposal, accuracy and efficiency are measured by user experiment. Our proposal tool was compared with the tool without probabilities of incorrect operation. As the result, in terms of accuracy, there are no significant difference between. However, our proposal demonstrate a 39.5% improved efficiency.

AB  - Security log analysis is extremely useful for uncovering intrusions and anomalies. However, the sheer volume of log data demands new frameworks and techniques of computing and security. We present a lightweight distributed and parallel security log analysis framework that allows organizations to analyze a massive number of system, network, and transaction logs efficiently and scalably. Different from the general distributed frameworks, e.g., MapReduce, our framework is specifically designed for security log analysis. It features a minimum set of necessary properties, such as dynamic task scheduling for streaming logs. For prototyping, we implement our framework in Amazon cloud environments (EC2 and S3) with a basic analysis application. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our design and shows the potential of our cloud-based distributed framework in large-scale log analysis scenarios.

AB  - Network security problems emerge in an endless stream and cause the inestimable damage. To solve network security problems efficiently, it is not enough to make good protection at nodes or protect networks from outside attacks. Many network security problems should be solved efficiently in collaborative approaches which can integrate various resources over internet to defense network security. In this paper, we have designed and implemented a collaborative network security platform based on P2P system. The nodes participated in the P2P system can publish their designed defensible services against network security problems. Based on the published services, collaborative network applications can be developed easily to solve the network security problems on demand. An experiment against TCP SYN flooding attack is demonstrated by the designed defensible services including packets sniffing, forwarding, filtering, and logging services, which can trace the attack origins and filter malicious traffic efficiently.

AB  - Although event recording on a computer system (also known as logging) is of utmost importance for reconstructing and detecting security relevant events, currently no adequate and sophisticated solution for complex environments, such as Grid and Cloud Computing, exist. Current LOG file formats lack of several important factors, hindering automatic evaluation needed for distributed systems to comply with laws and regulations or hindering detection of security breaches. In this paper we present a new concept utilizing XML technology to solve mentioned problems of current LOG file formats and describe the benefits of this new idea resulting in a flexible, interoperable LOG environment enabling automatic evaluation even in locally dispersed computing systems. As a result reliable, robust and consistent LOG files are produced allowing for automatic evaluation.

Ways to detect an intrusion and assess what the intruder did must be well thought out. For the most part, they will rely upon the ability of each system on the Internet to keep a log of events. The logs are invaluable for intrusion detection and analysis, indeed, they are basic to all postattack analysis. Authors of the security policy must determine what to log (keeping in mind how the desired level of logging will affect system performance) and how the logs should be analyzed. The logs should note who has entered the system as well as what they have done. Before a detailed examination is made of security methods, the issues affecting security enforcement are reviewed. The detection of intrusion using manual and automatic methods are discussed as are counterattack and damage assessment

AB  - Cloud computing offers computational resources such as processing, networking, and storage to customers. However, the cloud also brings with it security concerns which affect both cloud consumers and providers. The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) define the security concerns as the seven main threats. This paper investigates how threat number one (malicious activities performed in consumers' virtual machines/VMs) can affect the security of both consumers and providers. It proposes logging solutions to mitigate risks associated with this threat. We systematically design and implement a prototype of the proposed logging solutions in an IaaS to record the history of customer VM's files. The proposed system can be modified in order to record VMs' process behaviour log files. These log files can assist in identifying malicious activities (spamming) performed in the VMs as an example of how the proposed solutions benefits the provider side. The proposed system can record the log files while having a smaller trusted computing base compared to previous work. Thus, the logging solutions in this paper can assist in mitigating risks associated with the CSA threats to benefit consumers and providers.

AB  - Internet is growing very rapidly; so is its security issues. There are a wide variety of attacks possible in networked machines. DOS attack, buffer overflow attack, cross site attack, DNS exploit attack are a few to name. Without security measures and controls in place, network and data might be subjected to attacks. The commonly deployed security devices are firewall, IDS, IPS, anti-virus etc. Potential number of threats is still pervading which are formulated as attacks by combining many unnoticed primitive events. The best solution is to install a Complex Event Processing (CEP) system which can analyze multiple devices to infer attack patterns. Log information of network devices is the best choice for analysis. In a large network, there will be millions of events logged. Correlated analysis of this huge volume of log is the main challenge in Complex Event Processing (CEP) system. We describe a method to reduce the input to the Complex Event Processing (CEP) system, using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Our experiment shows that the input size can be considerably reduce using the classifier. Hence improves the working of Complex Event Processing (CEP) system.

AB  - Securely maintaining log records over extended periods of time is very important to the proper functioning of any organization. Integrity of the log files and that of the logging process need to be ensured at all times. In addition, as log files often contain sensitive information, confidentiality and privacy of log records are equally important. However, deploying a secure logging infrastructure involves substantial capital expenses that many organizations may find overwhelming. Delegating log management to the cloud appears to be a viable cost saving measure. In this paper, we identify the challenges for a secure cloud-based log management service and propose a framework for doing the same.

AB  - A huge amount of information about real-time events are being generated in every second in a running IT-Infrastructure and recorded by the system logs, application logs, as well as the output from the deployed security or management methods, e.g., IDS alerts, firewall logs, scanning reports, etc. To rapidly gather, process, correlate, and analyze the massive event information is a challenging task. High performance security analytics is proposed to address this challenge by which the real-time event information can be normalized, centralized, and correlated to help identify the current running state of the target environment. As an example of next generation Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform, Security Analytics Lab (SAL) has been designed and implemented based on the newly emerged In-Memory data management technique, which makes it possible to efficiently organize, access, and process different types of event information through a consistent central storage and interface. In this paper, the multi-core architecture is introduced on the event correlation module of SAL platform by which the correlation tasks can be executed in parallel by different computing resources. The k-means algorithm is implemented as an example of possible event clustering and correlation algorithms. Several experiments are conducted and analyzed to show that the performance of analytics can be significantly improved by applying multi-core architecture in the event correlation procedure.

AB  - Existing studies on problem reports in open source projects focus primarily on the analysis of the general category of problem reports, or limit their attention to observations on the number of security problem reports. To evaluate the security of a project, it is necessary to know not only how many security problem reports are logged but also how many are reported and how promptly they are corrected etc. In this paper, we study publicly disclosed security problem reports from eight releases of Fedora, nine releases of Ubuntu, four releases of RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and two releases of Suse Linux distributions, analyse and discuss which type of problem reports and how frequently they are reported, and how promptly they are corrected. Overall, Fedora and Suse show good results with high and medium severity security problem reports resolved without a backlog. On the other hand, RHEL and Ubuntu show less positive results with presence of backlogs.

AB  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) consists of a cloud-based infrastructure to offer consumers raw computation resources such as storage and networking. These resources are billed using a pay-per-use cost model. However, this type of infrastructure is far from being a security haven as the seven main threats defined by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) indicate. Using logging systems can provide evidence to support accountability for an IaaS cloud, which helps us mitigating known threats. In this paper, we research to which extent such logging systems help mitigate risks associated with the threats identified by the CSA. A generic architecture 'template' for logging systems is proposed. This template encompasses all possible instantiations of logging solutions for IaaS cloud. We map existing logging systems to our generic template, and identify a logging solution to mitigate the risks associated with CSA threat number one (related to spam activities). We then argue that the template we suggest can be used to perform a systematic analysis of logging systems in terms of security before deploying them in production systems.

AB  - Network administrators are able to correlate log file entries manually. Large volume and low quality of log files justify the need for further log processing. The manual log processing is lack of flexibility. It is time consuming, and one doesn't get the general view of the log files in the network. Without this general view it is hard to correlate information between the network components. Events seemingly unessential by themselves can in reality be a piece of a larger threat. In this regard, different log correlation methods are proposed to improve alert quality and to give a comprehensive view of system security. In this paper, we show how different attacks categorized in three categories with different behavior: Denial of service (DoS) attacks, user-to-root (U2R) &amp; remote-to-local (R2L) attacks and probing, are reflected in different logs and argue that some attacks are not evident when a single log is analyzed.

In this paper, we use source code model checking technique to check whether some security programming guidelines are followed, and correspondingly to detect related security vulnerabilities. Two SAP security programming guidelines related to logging sensitive information and Cross-Site Scripting attack are used as examples. In the case studies, Bandera Tool Set is used as source code model checker, and minimizing programmers' additional effort is set as one of the goals.

AB  - Event logs or log files form an essential part of any network management and administration setup. While log files are invaluable to a network administrator, the vast amount of data they sometimes contain can be overwhelming and can sometimes hinder rather than facilitate the tasks of a network administrator. For this reason several event clustering algorithms for log files have been proposed, one of which is the event clustering algorithm proposed by Risto Vaarandi, on which his simple log file clustering tool (SLCT) is based. The aim of this work is to develop a visualization tool that can be used to view log files based on the clusters produced by SLCT. The proposed visualization tool, which is called LogView, utilizes treemaps to visualize the hierarchical structure of the clusters produced by SLCT. Our results based on different application log files show that LogView can ease the summarization of vast amount of data contained in the log files. This in turn can help to speed up the analysis of event data in order to detect any security issues on a given application.

AB  - The differences in log file formats employed in a variety of services and applications remain to be a problem for security analysts and developers of intrusion detection systems. The proposed solution, i.e. the usage of common log formats, has a limited utilization within existing solutions for security management. In our paper, we reveal the reasons for this limitation. We show disadvantages of existing common log formats for normalisation of security events. To deal with it we have created a new log format that fits for intrusion detection purposes and can be extended easily. Taking previous work into account, we would like to propose a new format as an extension to existing common log formats, rather than a standalone specification.

AB  - System security and privacy always have to face new confronts. Continuous updates in the operating systems and anti-virus applications strive to amplify the system security level. In recent years 'key-loggers' have proved to be one of the prevalent intimidations to security and privacy. Key-logger is a surreptitious surveillance application, which is used to keep record of user's activities on the computer in various ways like keyboard logging, screen logging, mouse logging and voice logging, completely in imperceptible mode. Although key-loggers can also be used for prolific purposes but due to the tremendous increase in the Internet usage, the caustic use of key-loggers simply surmounts its advantages. Key-loggers have gained so much supremacy in their execution that they have become a serious intimidation to the privacy and security of a computer. The fact which makes the key-loggers more perilous is their undetectable nature against anti-virus and spy-where applications. This paper discusses some existing techniques of fortification against key-loggers and also exemplifies a new technique along with its proved advantages.

AB  - This paper discusses the security issues involved in log management for a multilevel secure database system and presents a design and implementation of a prototype multilevel secure log manager. The main goal of a log manager is to provide high bandwidth and low flush latency. We examine the performance of our design, by observing the flush latency and log bandwidth. We also informally evaluate the security of our approach

AB  - In this article, we raise some prohibited matters within the organizations from the viewpoint of information security measures, and investigate factors such as individual attributes and organizational attributes which impact the decision making on not complying with the rule. By using the collected data from a survey that we conducted in March 2010 and employing a stepwise log it model as a statistical tool, we analyze the relationships between decision making on not complying with the rule and some attributes. As a result, we found the some features of respondents who took problematic behavior. First of all, the psychological factors such as risk perception and risk aversion influence the problematic behaviors. Next, the high individuals' morals are able to prevent their taking problematic behaviors. Third, the individuals who experienced some information security accidents, or the individuals whose degree of workplace satisfaction is low, tend to take problematic behavior. In addition, by introducing power shift from ruling body to lower organization as the incentive system for employee's working, individuals come to tend to take problematic behaviors. Though with regard to factors such as the individual's attitude toward the risk and/or moral as the rule within the organization, we propose to educate and train about the information security and the awareness. On the other hand, factors such as the experience of information security accidents, the degree of workplace satisfaction and the incentive system for employee's working may be controlled by the organization by designing the appropriate organizational environment.

AB  - Log files helps cyber forensic process in inquiring and seizing computer, obtaining electronic evidence for criminal investigations and maintaining computer records for the federal rules of evidence. So it can be said that logging is closely related to Forensic Computing. To make the logs permissible for the use in court, there is a stipulation to prove that the logs have not been modified after being generated. Moreover, since the logs contain private information, they must be protected strictly. Therefore a secure logging scheme that ensures the integrity and confidentiality of the logs is needed. And, deploying a secure logging infrastructure involves ample capital expenses that many organizations may find devastating. Delegating log management to the cloud appears to be a feasible cost saving measure. The challenges for a secure cloud-based log management service are identified and Homomorphic Encryption Scheme is proposed for doing the same.

AB  - This paper addresses security and safety choices that involve a decision on the timing of an action. Examples of such decisions include when to check log files for intruders and when to monitor financial accounts for fraud or errors. To better understand how performance in timing-related security situations is shaped by individuals' cognitive predispositions, we effectively combine survey measures with economic experiments. Two behavioral experiments are presented in which the timing of online security actions is the critical decision-making factor. The feedback modality in the decision-environment is varied between visual feedback with history (Experiment 1), and temporal feedback without history (Experiment 2). Using psychometric scales, we study the role of individual difference variables, specifically risk propensity and need for cognition. The analysis is based on the data from over 450 participants. We find that risk propensity is not a hindrance in timing tasks. Participants of average risk propensity generally benefit from a reflective disposition (high need for cognition), particularly when visual feedback is given. Overall, participants benefit from need for cognition, however, in the more difficult, temporal-estimation task, this requires familiarity with the task.

AB  - Popup blocking, form filling, and many other features of modern web browsers were first introduced as third-party extensions. New extensions continue to enrich browsers in unanticipated ways. However, powerful extensions require capabilities, such as cross-domain network access and local storage, which, if used improperly, pose a security risk. Several browsers try to limit extension capabilities, but an empirical survey we conducted shows that many extensions are over-privileged under existing mechanisms. This paper presents ibex, a new framework for authoring, analyzing, verifying, and deploying secure browser extensions. Our approach is based on using type-safe, high-level languages to program extensions against an API providing access to a variety of browser features. We propose using Data log to specify fine-grained access control and dataflow policies to limit the ways in which an extension can use this API, thus restricting its privilege over security-sensitive web content and browser resources. We formalize the semantics of policies in terms of a safety property on the execution of extensions and develop a verification methodology that allows us to statically check extensions for policy compliance. Additionally, we provide visualization tools to assist with policy analysis, and compilers to translate extension source code to either. NET byte code or JavaScript, facilitating cross-browser deployment of extensions. We evaluate our work by implementing and verifying~NumExt extensions with a diverse set of features and security policies. We deploy our extensions in Internet Explorer, Chrome, Fire fox, and a new experimental HTML5 platform called C3. In so doing, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss our research in developing general and systematic methods for intrusion prevention. The key idea is to use data mining techniques to discover regular patterns of system features that describe program and user behavior. Server systems invariably write detailed activity logs whose value is useful in detecting intrusion. Unfortunately, production volumes overwhelm the capacity and manageability of traditional approach. This paper discusses the issues involving large-scale log processing that helps analyze log records. In this paper we propose to analyze intersections of log files that come from different applications and firewalls installed on one computer, and intersections resulting from log files coming from different computers. Intersections of log files are substantially smaller than full logs and consist of records that indicate abnormalities in accessing single computer or set of computers. The paper concludes with some lessons we learned in building the system

AB  - Monitoring log files for network intrusions is unwieldy. To build a mental model of the log, an analyst is required to recognise continuous timelines and attack patterns from a dataset that is essentially limited to an ordered list of events. Information Visualization techniques arrange data into directly perceivable visual patterns that may alleviate some overheads associated with interpreting these datasets and improve the ability of users, especially those in resource-stretched Small and Medium sized Businesses (SMBs), to make sense of activity patterns in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) event logs. To this end, we discuss existing network security visualizations for IDS logs and after examining the strengths and drawbacks of those applications we have prototyped a visualization tool, Pianola, that arranges events on multiple timelines to reveal patterns both in time and across a network. The tool was evaluated against the traditional use of command-line interface (CLI)-based tools for analyzing network security events and displayed significant improvements in both recognition and detection of attacks and reduction in the users' subjective workload, measured using the NASA Task Load index (TLX).

AB  - In response to attack against corporative and enterprise networks, administrators deploy intrusion detection systems, monitors, vulnerability scans and log systems. These systems monitor and record host and network device activities searching for signs of anomalies and security incidents. Doing that, these systems generally produce a huge number of alerts that overwhelms security analysts. This paper proposes the application of a conceptual clustering technique for filtering alerts and shows the results obtained for seven months of security alerts generated in a real large scale SaaS Cloud system. The technique has been useful to support manual analysis activities conducted by the operations team of the reference Cloud system.

AB  - Uncorrupted log files are the critical system component for computer forensics in case of intrusion and for real time system monitoring and auditing. Protection from tampering with information can be achieved using cryptographic functions that provide authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. However, they cannot provide the prerequisite for any further information processing, i.e., information availability. In this case, fault tolerant strategies can be of great help improving information availability in case of accidental or deliberate deletion. In this paper we propose a system that increases log file availability in case of software deletion by reliably and efficiently distributing the logs on multiple independent machines. The proposed scheme is more efficient than simple replication, both from the storage space and the network bandwidth points of view. The proposed system has been implemented and its impact on performance has been measured. Since it operates as a postprocessor after log generation, the proposed system can be easily integrated with logging systems that provide various cryptographic functions for forensic purposes

In particular, life-log information requires higher security considerations since it may contains very sensitive information about the user such as biological information, location, communication logs, etc. In this paper, first we discuss the risks of sharing life-log information in a social community. Then we will introduce a sharing model, which can eliminate the sharing capability of a life-log information object, based on the expiration time. Furthermore, general security approaches which might decrease security related risks for life-log systems will be described.

AB  - Today log traces are widely used to identify and prevent violations of corporate information systems. The most recent logging trend is to manage most level 3 ISO/OSI traffic via pcap-compatible output. But use of syslog is still very widespread, as are the security issues it entails, especially in its 'pure' version. This paper outlines the basic syslog problems as foreseen in the RFCs, examines the 'secure' alternatives to the protocol (and relative implementations) and proposes a transmission approach based on covert channels which, applied on the LINUX platform, might answer some of the intrinsic reliability problems which undermine its effectiveness as a digital forensic tool.

AB  - Mobile agent technology provides a promising means for the management of the large-scaled network, such as the Internet. But it also results in significant security threats to and from both malicious agents and hosts. Based on the analysis of the security threats that may occur during the mobile agent based network management applications, This work presents a security extension to a mobile agent system Grasshopper, and describes the main component of the extension: Mobile Agent Security Facility (MASF), MASF has several key features: 1) a secure mechanism for dispatching agents to given domains or network elements from secured agent repository; 2) provision of encrypted communication; 3) a safe mobile agents execution environment that gives mobile agents different resource access permissions according to the result of authentication and authorization; 4) logging services to record security relevant events. MASF architecture is further integrated and verified in a practical network management application: inter-domain IP VPN configuration. MASF is generic and can be used in other mobile agent applications.

AB  - This paper describes a forensic logging system that collects fine-grained evidence from target servers and networks. For the logging system, we developed a TCSEC-B1 level secure operating system and a dedicated network processor that collects network traffic. The logging system is also capable of protecting servers from malicious attacks as well as allowing security managers to obtain forensic evidences when the target server is assaulted by violations. We describe the design and implementation of the system and discuss the benchmark result of the prototype system.

AB  - Log event correlation is an effective means of detecting system faults and security breaches encountered in information technology environments. Centralized, database-driven log event correlation is common, but suffers from flaws such as high network bandwidth utilization, significant requirements for system resources, and difficulty in detecting certain suspicious behaviors. Distributed event correlation is often assumed to be superior, but no research effort has been made which quantitatively evaluates its advantages and disadvantages. This research presents a distributed event correlation system which performs security event detection, and evaluates it experimentally, compared with a centralized alternative. The comparison measures the value in distributed event correlation by considering network bandwidth utilization, detection capability and database query efficiency. The implementation of these advantages allows a 99% reduction of network syslog traffic in the low accountability case. In addition, the system detects every implemented malicious use case, with a low false positive rate.

AB  - This paper presents an in-depth study of the forensic data on security incidents that have occurred over a period of 5 years at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois. The proposed methodology combines automated analysis of data from security monitors and system logs with human expertise to extract and process relevant data in order to: (i) determine the progression of an attack, (ii) establish incident categories and characterize their severity, (iii) associate alerts with incidents, and (iv) identify incidents missed by the monitoring tools and examine the reasons for the escapes. The analysis conducted provides the basis for incident modeling and design of new techniques for security monitoring.

AB  - Nowadays, computer security has become important issue in many organizations in this world. There are many ways to handle this issue including by using Intrusion Detection System on the computer system. It takes the role as a detector for any intrusion that is occurring from the computer system. The study is to develop host based intrusion detection system for Microsoft Windows XP environment. Method that had used in the study was applying intrusion detection pattern matching technique on the Security Event Log File for Microsoft Windows XP. The intrusion had identified when there was matching of intrusion pattern that is create with Security Event Log in Microsoft Windows XP. The system is hoping to evolve into IDS that include any kind of intrusion detection technique in future.

AB  - In this paper, we examine issues related to the research and applications of computational intelligence techniques in security data analysis. We focus on solve problems that involve incomplete, vague or uncertain information, which is difficult to come to a crisp solution. It is shown how an extended mass assignment framework can be used to extract relations between soft categories. These relations are association rules and are useful when integrating multiple information sources. Experimental results on terrorism incident databases and Web search logs, respectively relating to national security and user behaviour profiling, are demonstrated and discussed in this paper.

AB  - With the growth of communication networks, event logs are increasing in size at a fast rate. Today, it is not uncommon to have systems that generate tens of gigabytes of log data per day. Log data are likely to contain information that deserves closer attention - such as security events - but the task of reviewing logs manually is beyond the capabilities of a human. This paper discusses data mining tools SLCT and log hound that were designed for assisting system management personnel in extracting knowledge from event logs.

AB  - As information systems start to manage the more crucial parts of human lives, their security cannot be neglected. One way to ensure the security is by analyzing their generated log files of anomalous user activity. Data visualization has become a common solution to help get around the problems in log analysis. In this paper, we tried to determine key characteristics of effective data visualization on detecting those anomalous user activity recorded in log files. First we analyzed the log data we have and derived 4 anomalies whose indicators are made into visualization topics. Hence we built 4 data visualizations to detect the 4 anomalies. Next, we transformed our data so that they can be visualized. After that, we analyzed the suitable time-based data visualization method to represent our data and decided on heatmap for its wide application on existing solutions and dot plot for it is able to accommodate all data variables needed on every visualization topic and has the suitable nuance for monitoring purposes. Next we decided on design concept of our data visualizations and implemented them as web-based data visualization. We conducted 2 tests in this paper to determine the key characteristics of effective data visualization. Even though the results are inconclusive, but they hinted that an effective data visualization on this matter should support large amount of perceived information through cognition and support focused exploration.

AB  - Computer system log analysis should proactively support information security decisions of all types. These security decisions will likely include whether to update configurations, close ports, block access, patch systems, maneuver the system elements, or to do nothing because the risk is acceptable. In a world with Big Data, and a heterogeneous, distributed enterprise, log analysis can be difficult at best. There is so much data from a multitude of logs (e.g. event, application, and security) within the enterprise. On top of that, enterprises have varying configurations based on hardware, software, current patch level, and operating systems. Logs must track all of this data on all of these devices. The authors suggest that semantic technologies hold one key to providing a capability for proactive, and more meaningful, log analysis.

AB  - Threats to modern ICT systems are rapidly changing these days. Organizations are not mainly concerned about virus infestation, but increasingly need to deal with targeted attacks. This kind of attacks are specifically designed to stay below the radar of standard ICT security systems. As a consequence, vendors have begun to ship self-learning intrusion detection systems with sophisticated heuristic detection engines. While these approaches are promising to relax the serious security situation, one of the main challenges is the proper evaluation of such systems under realistic conditions during development and before roll-out. Especially the wide variety of configuration settings makes it hard to find the optimal setup for a specific infrastructure. However, extensive testing in a live environment is not only cumbersome but usually also impacts daily business. In this paper, we therefore introduce an approach of an evaluation setup that consists of virtual components, which imitate real systems and human user interactions as close as possible to produce system events, network flows and logging data of complex ICT service environments. This data is a key prerequisite for the evaluation of modern intrusion detection and prevention systems. With these generated data sets, a system's detection performance can be accurately rated and tuned for very specific settings.

AB  - An increasing number of factory automation systems are connected to the Internet or other public networks, and secured by firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), etc. In order to detect attacks, correlation of firewalls, router, proxy, and IDS logs is necessary. Successful correlation requires, among other things, synchronized time stamps for all the log entries created by different sources. The automation system usually contains a rather accurate time source, which could be used to derive the time base for all system components, including the above-mentioned security mechanisms. A number of standard protocols exist for time synchronization. It will be shown that these protocols do not fulfill the necessary security requirements. In particular, they open up the automation system network to denial-of-service attacks from the outside. Various design alternatives and the requirements for an alternative time synchronization protocol are discussed.

AB  - In the UNIX/Linux environment the kernel can log every command process created by every user with process accounting. Thus process accounting logs have many potential uses, particularly the monitoring and forensic investigation of security events. Previous work successfully leveraged the use of process accounting logs to identify a difficult to detect and damaging intrusions within high performance computing (HPC) clusters, masquerade attacks, where intruders pose as legitimate users with purloined authentication credentials. This paper incrementally advances the goal of more accurately identifying masqueraders on HPC clusters by seeking to identify features within command sets that distinguish masqueraders. To accomplish this goal, we created NVision-PA, a software tool which produces text and graphic statistical summaries describing input processing accounting logs. This research is both a promising next step toward creating a real-time masquerade detection sensor for production HPC clusters as well as providing another tool for system administrators to use for statistically monitoring and managing legitimate workloads in HPC environments

AB  - Nowadays, many organizations find it economically attractive to host their services in a cloud environment. Still, security remains the number one concern for many organizations in adopting the cloud services. In this paper, we assess and study the security of a typical cloud environment as that of the popular Amazon AWS Cloud. The cloud security is assessed by deploying and running Dionaea honeypots for a few months in the cloud provide networks. Collected data and logs from Dionaea honeypots show that the cloud environment is surprisingly insecure and is in fact a target of malicious activities and attacks from different countries.

AB  - With the explosive rapid expansion of computer use during the past few years, security has become a crucial issue for modern computer systems. Today, there are so many intrusion detection systems (IDS) on the Internet. A variety of intrusion detection techniques and tools exist in the computer security community. We can easily download, install and configure them to our needs. But there is a potential problem involved with intrusion detection systems that are installed locally on the machines to be monitored. If the system being monitored is compromised, it is quite likely that the intruder will alter the system logs and the intrusion logs while the intrusion remains undetected. In this project KIT-I, we adopt remote logging server (RLS) mechanism, which is used to backup the log files to the server. Taking into account security, we make use of the function of SSL of Java and certificate authority (CA) based on key management. Furthermore, neural networks are applied in our project to detect the intrusion activities.

AB  - Cluster style architectures are becoming increasingly important in the computing world. These machines have been the target of several recent attacks. In this paper, we examine how the unique characteristics of these machines, including how they are generally operated in the larger context of a computing center, can be leveraged to provide better security for these machines. We examine this by incorporating data from a batch scheduler and a user database to augment our automated log analysis using the freely available log analysis tool LoGS.

AB  - Security is one of the biggest concerns of any company that has an IT infrastructure. Windows event logs are a very useful source of data for security information, but sometimes can be nearly impossible to use due to the complexity of log data or the number of events generated per minute. For this reason, event log data must be automatically processed so that an administrator is given a list of events that actually need the administrator's attention. This has been standard in intrusion detection systems for many years to find anomalies in network traffic, but has not been common in event log processing. This paper will adapt these intrusion detection techniques for Windows event log data sets to find anomalies in these log data sets.

AB  - In this paper we describe the architecture, implementation, and performance of a face verification system that continually verifies the presence of a logged-in user at a computer console. It maintains a sliding window of about ten seconds of verification data points and uses them as input to a Bayesian framework to compute a probability that the logged-in user is still present at the console. If the probability falls below a threshold, the system can delay or freeze operating system processes belonging to the logged-in user. This helps prevent misuse of computer resources when an unauthorized user maliciously takes the place of an authorized user. Processes may be unconditionally frozen (they never return from a system call) or delayed (it takes longer to complete a system call, or appropriate action may be taken for certain classes of system calls, such as those that are considered security critical. We believe that the integrated system presented here is the first of its kind. Furthermore, we believe that the analysis of the tradeoffs between verification accuracy, processor overhead, and system security that we do in this paper has not been done elsewhere

AB  - SQL Injection Attack (SQLIA) has made to the top of the OWASP, Top 10 Web Application Security Risks in 2013 and in 2010. The explosive use of web application with very little emphasis lay on securing it make this attack becoming more popular. Various methods have been discussed and proposed as countermeasure to the attack. Unfortunately, most of them are seen to be not comprehensive enough to address any kind of issues an organization might have when it comes to hardening the web security such as technical and financial matter for instance. This study presents a way to prevent and detect intrusion through the deployment of reverse proxy with an intrusion and prevention mechanism built in against web attacks especially SQLIA. With the flexibility offered in server logging process, we obtain and analyse preferred data to visualize the type of attack based on logs information. Our graph visualization development monitors three web security aspects, i.e. the top traffic blocked attempted by IP address, number of regular expression rules violated and detect the rules of intrusion detection.

AB  - Online web-based application that heavily require user interaction, either among users or among users and the application, generate huge amounts of data. Recording such user interaction data, usually in the form of log data files, could be very useful for different purposes such as user modelling, user activity analysis, data analytics, security, monitoring, etc. However, such data is not ready to be analysed due log files are to be pre-processed and cleaned up from redundant and futile information. Due to the large amounts of data generated daily, the massive processing is a foremost step in extracting useful information from log data files. In this work we study the viability of massive processing of log data files of a real Virtual Campus using different distributed infrastructures. More precisely, we study the time performance of processing daily log files of a Virtual Campus using cluster computing(under Open Grid Engine) and Planet Lab platform. The study reveals the complexity and challenges of massive processing in the big data era.

AB  - Information security requires a method to establish digital credentials that can reliably identify individual users. Since biometrics is concerned with the measurements of unique human physiological or behavioural characteristics, the technology has been used to verify the identity of computer or network users. Given today's heightened security requirements of military as well as other applications such as banking, health care, etc., it is becoming critical to be able to monitor the presence of the authenticated user throughout a session. This paper presents a prototype system that uses facial recognition technology to monitor the authenticated user. The objective is to ensure that the user who is using the computer is the same person that logged onto the system. A neural network-based algorithm is implemented to carry out face detection, and an eigenface method is employed to perform facial recognition. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed which allows the performance of face detection and facial recognition to be monitored at run time. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of near-real-time continuous user verification for high-level security information systems.

AB  - In monitoring security of enterprise or campus networks, detecting attacks from internal network to external network is becoming more and more important. After detecting such attacks, finding the location of the target PC is sometimes needed. This paper describes a visual security monitoring system for large-scale local area network. The system integrates three information, logical, temporal, and geographical information, in one 3D visualization. The system also provides effective interaction capabilities and filtering mechanism. IDS logs obtained at the computer center of our university were visualized, and typical examples such as botnet activities and SSH brute force attack were discussed.

Unfortunately, the DNS has a number of significant security weaknesses that can result in the compromise of Web sites, e-mail messages, and log-in sessions. Additionally, these weaknesses have been used as the basis for man-in-the-middle attacks on what are considered secure network protocols. This paper provides a short description of the weaknesses of the current DNS and a description of DNS security extensions that will solve the existing insecurities.

AB  - The authors have begun to address the problem of anonymized data with the development of a new prototype tool CANINE: Converter and ANonymizer for Investigating Netflow Events. Originally, just a NetFlow converter, CANINE has been adapted to anonymize 8 of the most common fields found in all NetFlow formats. Most of these fields can be anonymized in multiple ways providing trade-offs between security and utility. This is the first tool the authors are aware of that supports many levels of anonymization and is the only NetFlow anonymizer of which we are aware ?? besides a previous, less advanced tool they developed. This article is organized as follows. part 2 discusses related work in log anonymization. Part 3 discusses CANINE??s anonymization algorithms and design decisions in depth. Finally, part 4 concludes and presents future work on CANINE and the anonymization of other log types.

AB  - Computer logs are generated by application activities, network accesses and system audit, which are important data sources for user pattern mining, computer forensic analysis, intrusion detection analysis and outlier detection. Algorithms for mining association rule are useful methods to find interesting rules implied in large computer log data. But existing algorithms which based on confidence and support are unfit for mining computer log data, many uninteresting rules will be generated and useful rules will be shadowed. To solve this problem, the concept of key attributes of network log data is introduced, and an algorithm with key attributes constraints for mining interesting association rules in network log data is designed. Experimental result shows that the number of uninteresting rules can be reduced effectively and the validity of rules which mined are improved.

AB  - This paper presents a privacy-preserving framework for organizations that need to share their logs of intrusion detection systems with a centralized intrusion log management center. This centralized center may be an outsourced company that provides an intrusion detection management service to organizations or a system of the National Computer Emergency Response Team that probes the attacks targeting organizations that have critical information systems. For reasons of ensuring privacy, we adopt the notion of l-Diversity in the course of collecting intrusion logs from organizations. Within our framework, an organization ensures the people in the center cannot discern the exact origin of any intrusion log among the other l-1 organizations. Also, it is not possible to precisely identify the classification type of an intrusion log from among other l-1 types. Within this framework, the intrusion log management center can analyze the anonymous data, since the proposed privacy preserving solution creates little information loss. If required, it sends an alarm to the appropriate organization within a reasonable time. The center has the option of publishing useful information security statistics about specific organizations or about the whole ecosystem by using the privacy preserved intrusion logs.

AB  - Current online banking only allows payment to be made from a single bank account hence user needs to log in to several banking sites to settle the dues monthly. Paying bills/loans from multiple bank accounts in a single login would provide greater convenience. This paper reviewed the current on line banking system and discussed the challenges in designing an integrated web based application for independent personal financial organizer called I-PFO. I-PFO allows users to settle their financial commitments from multiple banks in a single website. It also provides ease of use, tracking due dates, organizing and personalization. The challenges of such system are security, value proposition to attract collaboration from banks and user acceptance. This paper focuses on security solutions for I-PFO.

AB  - A key tree is a distributed data structure of security keys that can be used by a group of users. In this paper we describe how any user in the group can use the different keys in the key tree to securely multicast data to different subgroups within the group. The cost of securely multicasting data to a subgroup whose users are "consecutive" is O(log n) encryptions, where n is the total number of users in the group. The cost of securely multicasting data to an arbitrary subgroup is O(n/2) encryptions. However this cost can be reduced to one encryption by introducing an additional key tree to the group.

AB  - Current collaborative tools are often not able to profit from existing systems for user management. It is therefore necessary for collaborative systems to administrate their users using their own solutions, which may not be adequate in terms of scalability or security. Many users may also experience problems working with authentication credentials (e.g. digital certificates) employed by collaborative systems. In this paper, we propose a general framework to provide easy-to-use yet secure access to collaborative systems, which offers a general middleware layer to accommodate various types of collaborative tools. The framework utilizes the emerging model of federations, which allows to provide a user-friendly means of logging in to a collaborative system as well as a solid basis for specifying access control policies. The framework handles all security aspects in a transparent way without requiring the users to perform complicated tasks. Using user attributes maintained in the federation, it is also possible to implement efficient and dynamic group management of the collaborating users.

AB  - The omnipresence of e-services running on various instances of pervasive e-infrastructures that are fundamental to the contemporary information society generates an abundance of digital evidence. The evidence in a digital form stems from a myriad of sources ranging from stand alone computers and their volatile and non-volatile storages, to mobile small scale digital devices, network traffic, ever-present applications comprising social networks, ISP records, logs, Web pages, databases and both global and local information systems. The acquisition and the analysis of this evidence is crucial to understanding and functioning of the digital world, regardless of the positive or negative implications of the actions and the activities that generated the evidence. In the case of the later, when the evidence comes from illegal, illicit and malicious activities, the protection of digital evidence is of major concern for the law enforcement and legal institutions, namely for investigators and prosecutors. To protect the integrity of the digital evidence, a number of security methods are used. These methods differ in terms of performance, accuracy, security levels, computational complexity, potential errors and the statistical admissibility of the produced results, as well as the vulnerabilities to accidental or malicious modifications. The work presented deals with the evaluation of these security methods in order to study and understand their &#x201C;goodness&#x201D; and suitability to protect the integrity of the digital evidence. The immediate outcome of the evaluation is a set of recommendations to be considered for selecting the right algorithm to protect integrity of the digital evidence in general.

AB  - Security vulnerability research has long been hindered by the difficulty in obtaining structured, detailed data on individual vulnerabilities in sufficient quantities for analysis. We mined vulnerabilities from historical change log data from Linux distribution packages, tapping a yet-unexplored source of security data. Change logs provide a unified view of a application's evolution, version branching structure, and vulnerability patching history, allowing for the large-scale compilation of data on susceptible (and, in some cases, non-susceptible) versions of the original application for each vulnerability. We then compiled vulnerability datasets for multiple releases of Debian and Ubuntu Linux, analyzing trends in vulnerability patching over time. Patching practices in Debian and Ubuntu were similar, and patch rates stayed constant throughout each distribution's lifetime.

In cloud computing, all the commands through the network connection, therefore, information security is particularly important. In this paper, we will explore the types of intrusion detection systems, and integration of these types, provided an effective and output reports, so system administrators can understand the attacks and damage quickly. With the popularity of cloud computing, intrusion detection system log files are also increasing rapidly, the effect is limited and inefficient by using the conventional analysis system. In this paper, we use Hadoop's MapReduce algorithm analysis of intrusion detection System log files, the experimental results also confirmed that the calculation speed can be increased by about 89%. For the system administrator, IDS Log Cloud Analysis System (called ICAS) can provide fast and high reliability of the system.

AB  - An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors network traffic and monitors for suspicious activity and alerts the system or network administrator. It identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. However, current high volumes of network traffic overwhelm most IDS techniques requiring new approaches that are able to handle huge volume of log and packet analysis while still maintaining high throughput. Hadoop, an open-source computing platform of MapReduce and a distributed file system, has become a popular infrastructure for massive data analytics because it facilitates scalable data processing and storage services on a distributed computing system consisting of commodity hardware. The proposed architecture is able to efficiently handle large volumes of collected data and consequent high processing loads using Hadoop, MapReduce and cloud computing infrastructure. The main focus of the paper is to enhance the throughput and scalability of the IDS Log analysis. Once enough data is gathered, it is necessary to rapidly analyze it and determine whether any attacks or malicious activities are present, which is the main issue that impacts IDS performance.

AB  - Cloud Computing is a new type of service which provides large scale computing resource to each customer. Cloud Computing systems can be easily threatened by various cyber attacks, because most of Cloud Computing systems provide services to so many people who are not proven to be trustworthy. Therefore, a Cloud Computing system needs to contain some Intrusion Detection Systems(IDSs) for protecting each Virtual Machine(VM) against threats. In this case, there exists a tradeoff between the security level of the IDS and the system performance. If the IDS provide stronger security service using more rules or patterns, then it needs much more computing resources in proportion to the strength of security. So the amount of resources allocating for customers decreases. Another problem in Cloud Computing is that, huge amount of logs makes system administrators hard to analyse them. In this paper, we propose a method that enables Cloud Computing system to achieve both effectiveness of using the system resource and strength of the security service without trade-off between them.

AB  - Upon an intrusion, security staff must analyze the IT system that has been compromised, in order to determine how the attacker gained access to it, and what he did afterward. Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.

AB  - Traditional methods of logging system activity are fundamentally insecure, which means that an attacker may compromise or tamper the logs. A novel method, Xen-based secure logging system call, is used to provide tamper-free logs of system call for some intrusion detection analysis techniques, which only require sequences of system call within a user process. Preliminary evaluation showed that the prototype is simple and efficient.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel system design using a chip multiprocessor (CMP) to provide intrusion tolerance and self-recovery for server applications. Our platform provides three major advantages over previously proposed approaches, 1) security insulation from remote exploits and attacks; 2) close coupling between processor cores in a CMP to ensure immediate logging, fine-grained inspection and fast recovery; 3) concurrent and fine-grained inspection, logging and recovery techniques that are off of the critical path. We have designed a multi-point defense and recovery system to defeat remote exploits. We used a checkpoint based approach to recover server applications under attack. It takes a snapshot of the application's context and memory state before it handles the next request. If the request turns out to be malicious, the system can discard the malicious request and rollback the application's state to a known good one through checkpointing. We have also designed an rapid recovery system for kernel space rootkit attacks. Our intrusion survivable and self-recovery design provides reliable production services that System Administrators are seeking

AB  - Shared Web Hosting service enables hosting multitude of websites on a single powerful server. It is a well-known solution as many people share the overall cost of server maintenance and also, website owners do not need to deal with administration issues is not necessary for website owners. In this paper, we illustrate how shared web hosting service works and demonstrate the security weaknesses rise due to the lack of proper isolation between different websites, hosted on the same server. We exhibit two new server-side attacks against the log file whose objectives are revealing information of other hosted websites which are considered to be private and arranging other complex attacks. In the absence of isolated log files among websites, an attacker controlling a website can inspect and manipulate contents of the log file. These attacks enable an attacker to disclose file and directory structure of other websites and launch other sorts of attacks. Finally, we propose several countermeasures to secure shared web hosting servers against the two attacks subsequent to the separation of log files for each website.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a secure logging scheme for Forensic Computing. Forensic Computing is the process conducted to identify the method of an attack and intruders in the case of system compromise. In Forensic Computing, trustworthy logs admissible for court are needed. Moreover, since the log contains various confidential information, the confidentiality of the log must be preserved. Our scheme achieves the integrity of logs and fine-grained access control for logs with small overhead size using the signature tree and Forward Integrity.

AB  - When computer intrusions occur, one of the most costly, time-consuming, and human-intensive tasks is to analysis and take the evidence of the compromised system. IR4CF: a system call based intrusion replay system for supporting the computer forensics. IR4CF uses three key mechanisms to improve the accuracy and reduce the human overhead of performing forensic analysis. First, it streams the kernel event information in real-time, to append-only storage on a separate, hardened, logging machine, making the system resilient to a wide variety of attacks. Second, it uses system-call hijacking technology to perform comprehensive monitoring of the execution of a target system at the kernel event level, giving a high-resolution, application-independent view of all activity. Third, it analyses and replays the intrusion actions dynamically, which can be used for evidence in a court of law.

AB  - Behaviors of users in a computer or a computer network can be observed by system authorities via logs of all the actions. In a computer or network system, if at some point the fact that the content of a secret file is leaking has been already known, to figure out the reasons of the leaking, we can search partial or entire log files to find out direct or indirect accesses to the file; since a user who accessed the secret before may send messages containing the secret to other users (the secret is leaking due to indirect accesses) via packets in a computer network, or via pipe/FIFO/message-queue/etc. in a computer system, finding the reasons of the leaking is not a trivial task. In this paper, we analyze and simulate the complexity of retrieving knowledge from the computer and network auditing log database for forensics and accountability.

AB  - The Internet is being widely used these days and many users are required to manage their network environments, because damages caused by worms, which spread using security holes of software, are also increasing rapidly. One of the effective means of detecting the damages caused by the worms in early stage is to analyze the network communication logs stored in computers that are spread over a wide area. However, almost all network administrators are not able to install many observation points, though a large number of observation points over a wide area of a network are needed to grasp symptoms of attacks precisely. In this paper, we propose an agent based log analyzing system by integrating the concepts of P2P network and mobile agents to realize detection and protection from the damages which may be caused by the worms in early stage. We also show results of experiments using our prototype system. The results show that our system can collect useful information from a wide area of a network, and provide means of flexible and on-demand analysis of network traffic logs to detect hostile attacks on the network.

Information extracted from the medical record archive is used to create mini-Webs of interlinked pages that may be viewed using a standard browser. The main features of the reported project are its multilingual nature-of particular significance in Europe, the provision of strict secure measures, and the support of usage profiles. Medical data may be viewed either in Greek-the language in which the data are stored-or in English, through an automated translation process. Security measures are as follows: (1) a password is required for access; (2) all transactions are logged (3) the patient's name and medical data are never transmitted together; (4) mini-Webs are deleted when the transaction is complete, (5) the remote user never has direct access to the central database

AB  - MapReduce is a framework for performing data intensive computations in parallel on commodity computers. When MapReduce is carried out in distributed settings, users maintain very little control over these computations, causing several security and privacy concerns. MapReduce activities may be subverted or compromised by malicious or cheating nodes. In this paper, we focus on the analysis and detection of attacks launched by malicious or mis configured nodes, which may tamper with the ordinary functions of the MapReduce framework. Our goal is to investigate the extent to which integrity and correctness of computation in a MapReduce environments can be verified while introducing no modifications on the original MapReduce operations or introductions of extra operations, neither computational nor cryptographic. We identify a number of data and computation integrity checks against aggregated low-level system traces and Hadoop logs, correlated with one another to obtain insights on the operations being performed by nodes. This information is then matched against system and program invariants to effectively detect malicious activities, from lazy nodes to nodes changing input/output or completing different computations.

AB  - Today's computer networks produce a huge amount of security log data. Handling this data is impossible without using Security Information and Event Management Systems (SIEM) to centralize the log management and increase the level of information security and data protection in the organization. SIEM collect and aggregate log data from various devices and applications through software called agents or connectors, filter uninteresting data and normalize to a proprietary format, analyses through correlation using contextual information and alert administrators in case of attack. SIEM provide proactive threat detection and real-time analysis of system activity. Handling these issues will be very hard without relying on consolidated, big data-powered SIEM. However, even having the most expensive SIEM solution, the organization should not expect the product to work great out of the box. The best SIEM solution does not guarantee success. The organization should focus on building various use cases to make their SIEM solution a success. In this paper, we propose a new model and architecture for SIEM implementation that is using multiple hierarchical SIEM Managers. The model is called &#x201C;Hierarchical Managers Model&#x201D;. We demonstrated how this model and architecture could be created and enabled in the leading SIEM system - ArcSight ESM [7]. We also provide examples of possible use cases that we have created and tested in our testing environment. These are meant to provide a good base starting point and should not be considered comprehensive for all situations. The use cases shown in this paper are created using the security event correlation framework from Hewlett-Packard - ArcSight ESM [7].

AB  - With the pervasive use of smart mobile devices and increasing wireless networking technologies, collaborations among mobile users are becoming deeper and ubiquitous. Appropriate task collaborations among mobile users could effectively improve the network processing ability with so called `mobile cloud' or `cloudlet'. However, task allocations confront with the security issues. The possible collusion or re-collaborations among the mobile users would possibly merge the allocated tasks of the specific users. Moreover, considering the delivery reliability and task execution efficiency, replications are applied for enhancement, which would also lead to more sever security threat for users. We investigate how to secure the security when task collaborations are allowed for mobile users. Our security scheme is built upon the load balancing scheme, and our intuitive solution is, if the tasks could be effectively balanced among users, the security issues could be guaranteed, because averaging the task assignment could effectively raise the threshold for collusion among potential malicious users. In this work, we propose `SAFE-CROWD': a secure task offloading and reassignment scheme among mobile users. The basic idea is simple, we leverage the `ball and bin' theory for task assignment, where d mobile users in contact range are investigated, and we select the least loaded ones among them. It has been proved that, such simple cases can effectively reduce the largest queueing length from &#x03B8;(log n/log log n) to &#x03B8;(log log n/log d). Inspired by this theoretical result, we develop a task reassignment policy for security issues. Simulation studies have shown that, our simple but effective scheme could enhance the security for mobile users, when the tasks are collaboratively executed among mobile devices.

AB  - Importance of web security cannot be overemphasized in the era of web-based economy. Although anomaly detection has long been considered a promising alternative to signature-based misuse detection technique, most studies to date used either small scale or artificially generated attack data. In this paper, based on security analysis applied on anonymous www.microsoft.com log of about 250 GB, we propose Anomaly Feature Matrix (AFM) as an effective framework to characterize anomalies. Feature selection of AFM is based on the characteristics of well-known (e.g., DDoS) attacks as well as patterns of anomalous logs found in the Microsoft data. Independent security analysis performed on the same data by Microsoft security engineers concluded that 1) We did not miss any major attacks; and 2) AFM is a general enough framework to characterize likely web attacks. In order to assist AFM-based anomaly analysis in large organizations, we implemented an interactive and visual analysis tool named ADAM (Anomaly Detection Assistant based on feature Matrix). Integrated with mapping software such as Virtual Earth, ADAM enables efficient and focused security analysis on web logs.

AB  - The inability to effectively track data in cloud computing environments is becoming one of the top concerns for cloud stakeholders. This inability is due to two main reasons. Firstly, the lack of data tracking tools built for clouds. Secondly, current logging mechanisms are only designed from a system-centric perspective. There is a need for data-centric logging techniques which can trace data activities (e.g. file creation, edition, duplication, transfers, deletions, etc.) within and across all cloud servers. This will effectively enable full transparency and accountability for data movements in the cloud. In this paper, we introduce S2Logger, a data event logging mechanism which captures, analyses and visualizes data events in the cloud from the data point of view. By linking together atomic data events captured at both file and block level, the resulting sequence of data events depicts the cloud data provenance records throughout the data lifecycle. With this information, we can then detect critical data-related cloud security problems such as malicious actions, data leakages and data policy violations by analysing the data provenance. S2Logger also enables us to address the gaps and inadequacies of existing system-centric security tools.

AB  - In this paper, we present the design and the implementation of the dataflow pointcut in AspectJ compiler ajc 1.5.0. Some security concerns are sensitive to flow of information in a program execution. The dataflow pointcut has been proposed by Masuhara and Kawauchi in order to easily implement such security concerns in aspect-oriented programming languages. The pointcut identifies join points based on the origins of values. The dataflow pointcut can detect and fix a lot of vulnerabilities that result from not validating input effectively, e.g., Web application vulnerabilities, process injection, log forging, and path injection. AspectJ extends the Java programming language to implement crosscutting concerns modularly in general. The implementation methodology of the dataflow pointcut which depends in define-use analysis is described in detail together with case studies that demonstrate how the implemented dataflow pointcut can detect a considerable number of vulnerabilities.

AB  - Existing security monitoring sensors such as IDS/IPS, firewalls, filtering routers, and others often record logs and subsequently generate alerts to warn security analysts of what is perceived as posing security threat to the environment or organization they are monitoring. Unfortunately, these logs and alerts are not only huge in number but also poor in data quality i.e. containing false logs/alerts. This in turn poses two main challenges to higher-level operations; first computationally efficient algorithms are needed to process and shift through large unverified logs and alerts. Second is the need to develop algorithms that avoid making wrong conclusions due to poor quality logs and alerts. In this paper, we implement intrusion alert quality framework to reduce false positive alerts in IDS. Using this framework, we enrich each alert with quality parameters such as correctness, accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity. To compliment this effort, we normalize the enriched alerts in the IDMEF format. In this form (enriched and normalized), higher level operations are given the option to utilize the quality parameters values tagged in the alerts in their core operations in order to produce good conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in reducing false positive alerts using DARPA 2000 network traffic.

AB  - Organizations rely on physical, digital and social mechanisms to protect their IT systems. Of all IT systems, laptops are probably the most troublesome to protect, since they are easy to remove and conceal. When the thief has physical possession of the laptop, it is also difficult to protect the data inside. In this study, we look at the effectiveness of the security mechanisms against laptop theft in two universities. The study considers the physical and social protection of the laptops. We analyze the logs from laptop thefts in both universities and complement the results with penetration tests. The results from the study show that the effectiveness of security mechanisms from the physical domain is limited, and it depends mostly from the social domain. The study serves as a motivation to further investigate the analysis of the alignment of the mechanisms across all three security domains to protect the IT assets in an organization.

AB  - Generally, fraud risk implies any intentional deception made for financial gain. In this paper, we consider this risk in the field of services which support transactions with electronic money. Specifically, we apply a tool for predictive security analysis at runtime which observes process behavior with respect to transactions within a money transfer service and tries to match it with expected behavior given by a process model. We analyze deviations from the given behavior specification for anomalies that indicate a possible misuse of the service related to money laundering activities. We evaluate the applicability of the proposed approach and provide measurements on computational and recognition performance of the tool - Predictive Security Analyser - produced using real operational and simulated logs. The goal of the experiments is to detect misuse patterns reflecting a given money laundering scheme in synthetic process behavior based on properties captured from real world transaction events.

AB  - As Cloud Computing becomes the trend of information technology computational model, the Cloud security is becoming a major issue in adopting the Cloud where security is considered one of the most critical concerns for the large customers of Cloud (i.e. governments and enterprises). Such valid concern is mainly driven by the Multi-Tenancy situation which refers to resource sharing in Cloud Computing and its associated risks where confidentiality and/or integrity could be violated. As a result, security concerns may harness the advancement of Cloud Computing in the market. So, in order to propose effective security solutions and strategies a good knowledge of the current Cloud implementations and practices, especially the public Clouds, must be understood by professionals. Such understanding is needed in order to recognize attack vectors and attack surfaces. In this paper we will propose an attack model based on a threat model designed to take advantage of Multi-Tenancy situation only. Before that, a clear understanding of Multi-Tenancy, its origin and its benefits will be demonstrated. Also, a novel way on how to approach Multi-Tenancy will be illustrated. Finally, we will try to sense any suspicious behavior that may indicate to a possible attack where we will try to recognize the proposed attack model empirically from Google trace logs. Google trace logs are a 29-day worth of data released by Google. The data set was utilized in reliability and power consumption studies, but not been utilized in any security study to the extent of our knowledge.

The result of simulation proves that the intrusion detection model and cooperation mechanism are adapted in the satellites network.

AB  - SCADA systems are widely used in electricity generation, distribution, and transmission control systems. NERC CIP 002-009 requires bulk electric providers to secure critical cyber assets electronically and physically. Transmission and distribution substations contain cyber critical assets including remote terminal units (RTU), intelligent electronic devices (IED) such as relays, phasor measurement units (PMU) and phasor data concentrators (PDC). Substation critical cyber assets are isolated in electronic security perimeters using firewalls. In this paper a retrofit data logger solution for serial communication based MODBUS and DNP3 network appliances is offered. The retrofit data logger allows existing control systems to be updated to log network transactions in support of substation based network intrusion detection. Substation based intrusion detection supports a defense in depth approach to cyber security in which multiple overlapping layers of security are used to protect critical cyber assets. The data logger is an embedded bump-in-the-wire retrofit device which captures, time stamps, cryptographically signs, encrypts, and store network traffic. Network traffic is forwarded to the existing network. Additionally, the data logger architecture supports use of signature based and statistics based intrusion detection algorithms at the network appliance edge.

AB  - Situation awareness (SA) in the cyber security domain is particularly relevant to teams of security analysts who are responsible for detecting cyber threats by perusing continual floods of data such as intrusion alerts and network logs. The challenges that analysts face are matched by those of researchers attempting to understand, measure, and impact SA in the cyber arena. The ground truth is not available except in simulated cyber situations. In this paper we outline a cognitive task analysis (CTA) focused on teams of analysts and the subsequent preliminary study conducted using a cyber defense simulation environment, CyberCog, built based on the CTA findings. Results from the CTA suggest three areas of fundamental challenge surrounding security analysts: team structure, communication, and information overload. These challenges could be associated to maladies such as cognitive tunneling and increased false alarms. These results are mirrored in the CyberCog pilot simulation study.

AB  - Forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past two decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.

AB  - Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer system or network and analyzing them for signs of possible incidents, which are violations of computer security policies, or standard security practices. Intrusion detection system identifies possible incidents, logs information and provides report about them. In this article a real time intrusion detection system using SNORT rules and KMP algorithm is implemented in reconfigurable hardware. The parallel structure of this architecture let us to achieve a high real time performance at rate 100Mbps as it is shown by simulation and synthesis results on VIRTEX4.

AB  - The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a widely used and well-established standard for classifying the severity of security vulnerabilities. For instance, all vulnerabilities in the US National Vulnerability Database (NVD) are scored according to this method. As computer systems typically have multiple vulnerabilities, it is often desirable to aggregate the score of individual vulnerabilities to a system level. Several such metrics have been proposed, but their quality has not been studied. This paper presents a statistical analysis of how 18 security estimation metrics based on CVSS data correlate with the time-to-compromise of 34 successful attacks. The empirical data originates from an international cyber defense exercise involving over 100 participants and were collected by studying network traffic logs, attacker logs, observer logs, and network vulnerabilities. The results suggest that security modeling with CVSS data alone does not accurately portray the time-to-compromise of a system. However, results also show that metrics employing more CVSS data are more correlated with time-to-compromise. As a consequence, models that only use the weakest link (most severe vulnerability) to compose a metric are less promising than those that consider all vulnerabilities.

AB  - Lazy controllers are a class of execution monitors that do not continuously observe the behaviour of their target. Monitors are activated and deactivated according to a scheduling strategy. When a lazy controller is activated, it checks the current security state and, in case of a violation, terminates the execution. Instead, if the current execution trace is safe, the monitor is suspended and its activation is scheduled again. The inactivity period is computed by considering the risk that, from the current state, the target can reach a faulty configuration. This behaviour is particularly interesting for systems which is difficult to monitor with standard solutions, e.g., web services. In this paper we present a prototype using existing logging API, i.e., the Commons Logging Package, for remotely watching the execution of OSGi bundles. We claim that our solution can efficiently follow the target system keeping under control the delay in detecting violations. Also, as we use standard OSGi platform and facilities, we show that our monitors can run under very realistic assumptions in the context of web services.

AB  - Every day we use a bevy of identity technologies to prove who we are to various systems, whether we are logging on to a virtual private network or buying from an online store. For users, this means an increasing number of passwords and routines, leading to security fatigue and occasional confusion. For developers, it means working with a hodgepodge of different identity technologies - a situation that doesn't help with maintenance, ongoing security risk analysis, or innovation. Microsoft's proposed answer to this problem is an identity metasystem - a framework that lets varying identity technologies communicate and interoperate using common standards

AB  - The growing demand for processing and storage capabilities has led to the deployment of high-performance computing infrastructures. Users log into the computing infrastructure remotely, by providing their credentials (e.g., username and password), through the public network and using well-established authentication protocols, e.g., SSH. However, user credentials can be stolen and an attacker (using a stolen credential) can masquerade as the legitimate user and penetrate the system as an insider. This paper deals with security incidents initiated by using stolen credentials and occurred during the last three years at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. We analyze the key characteristics of the security data produced by the monitoring tools during the incidents and use a Bayesian network approach to correlate (i) data provided by different security tools (e.g., IDS and Net Flows) and (ii) information related to the users' profiles to identify compromised users, i.e., the users whose credentials have been stolen. The technique is validated with the real incident data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in detecting compromised users, while allows eliminating around 80% of false positives (i.e., not compromised user being declared compromised).

AB  - In order to create a successful grid infrastructure, sites and resource providers must be able to publish information about their underlying resources and services. This information makes it easier for users and virtual organizations to make intelligent decisions about resource selection and scheduling, and can be used by the grid infrastructure for accounting and troubleshooting services. However, such an outbound stream may include data deemed sensitive by a resource-providing site, exposing potential security vulnerabilities or private user information to the world at large, including malicious entities. This study analyzes the various vectors of information being published from sites to grid infrastructures. In particular, it examines the data being published to, and collected by the Open Science Grid, including resource selection, monitoring, accounting, troubleshooting, logging and site verification data. We analyze the risks and potential threat models posed by the publication and collection of such data. We also offer some recommendations and best practices for sites and grid infrastructures to manage and protect sensitive data.

AB  - Websites are now widely used by many public and private sectors known to be the most popular system that is able to reach many users in many platforms through internet. Since websites are generally placed as a public domain, there is a large chance of intruders to compromise the system at any time. C-panel raw access log data nowadays widely used by many security tools to analysis the user behaviors regarding to the activities on the web, however they commonly provide the descriptive analysis, rather than prescriptive analysis for prediction and estimation. In this paper, we introduce the solution about the website security protection mechanism by investigating the user behaviors using sequential rule-pattern analysis. Rule-patterns of user behaviors are created by mining the log data with sequential pattern analysis in near real time. Using anomaly-based intrusion detection and prevention system approach, our proposed system then can predict the user behaviors activities whether identified as baseline patterns or malicious patterns.

AB  - Privacy protection is one of the fundamental security requirements for database outsourcing. A major threat is information leakage from database access patterns generated by query executions. The standard private information retrieval (PIR) schemes, which are widely regarded as theoretical solutions, entail <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) computational overhead per query for a database with <i>n</i> items. Recent works propose to protect access patterns by introducing a trusted component with constant storage size. The resulting privacy assurance is as strong as PIR, though with <i>O</i>(1) online computation cost, they still have <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) amortized cost per query due to periodically full database shuffles. In this paper, we design a novel scheme in the same model with provable security, which only shuffles a portion of the database. The amortized server computational complexity is reduced to <i>O</i>(&#x221A;{<i>n</i>log<i>n</i>/<i>k</i>}). With a secure storage storing thousands of items, our scheme can protect the access pattern privacy of databases of billions of entries, at a lower cost than those using ORAM-based poly-logarithm algorithms.

AB  - Intrusion Detection System (IDS) must reliably detect malicious activity. The expansion of web application also exponentially increases cyber threats. Current survey shows that application layer is more vulnerable to web attacks. There are more than 75% of attacks are deployed at application layer and out of that 90% are vulnerable to attacks. In this paper, we address issues of existing IDS i.e. low false positive rate, low false negative rate and data overload. We discuss about use of semantic web in the Intrusion Detection Systems. This article presents a proposition of using Semantic Web and Ontology concepts to define an approach to analyze Security logs with the goal to identify possible security issues. It extracts semantic relations between computer attacks and intrusions in an Intrusion Detection System. Ontology provides to enable, reuse of domain knowledge and it is also easier to understand and update legacy data.

AB  - Mobile Money Transfer (MMT) services provided by mobile network operators enable funds transfers made on mobile devices of end-users, using digital equivalent of cash (electronic money) without any bank accounts involved. MMT simplifies banking relationships and facilitates financial inclusion, and, therefore, is rapidly expanding all around the world, especially in developing countries. MMT systems are subject to the same controls as those required for financial institutions, including the detection of Money Laundering (ML) - a source of concern for MMT service providers. In this paper we focus on an often practiced ML technique known as micro-structuring of funds or smurfing and introduce a new method for detection of fraud chains in MMT systems. Whereas classical detection methods are based on machine learning and data mining, this work builds on Predictive Security Analysis at Runtime (PSA@R), a model-based approach for event-driven process analysis. We provide an extension to PSA@R which allows us to identify fraudsters in an MMT service monitoring network behavior of its end-users. We evaluate our method on simulated transaction logs, containing approximately 460,000 transactions for 10,000 end-users, and compare it with classical fraud detection approaches. With 99.81% precision and 90.18% recall, we achieve better recognition performance in comparison with the state of the art.

AB  - Modern computing has primarily shifted towards the distributed environment using commodity resources which results in increase in data and its security concern. This paper deals with design consideration of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on the Hadoop framework and acceleration of its performance by using General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GPGPU). The large volume of data from an entire infrastructure is assigned to Hadoop framework and intrusion detections are carried out on GPGPU. This approach improves NIDS performance and it enables to provide quick response to various attacks on the network. In order to perform the general purposed computation on the GPU, NVidia provides the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which is a parallel programming model which performs high-end complex operations using GPU. In order to process large volumes of data in distributed networks, Hadoop framework has to configure with various supporting ecosystems like Flume, Pig, Hive and HBase. These ecosystems enable the Hadoop framework to handle streaming data on the network and large log files on servers. The proposed system is capable of performing analytics over intrusion pattern and their behavior on the network, which helps a network administrator to configure network security policy and settings. Analytics over intrusion is done by using a Score-Weight approach called as Pattern Frequency Inverse Cluster Frequency (PF-ICF). The design consideration of accelerated NIDS is a solution towards the performance issues of various NIDS that faces due to the large volumes of the network traffic.

AB  - The technology of storage virtualization is widely used all around the world. The out-of-band network-based virtualization is an essential tendency of storage systems. According to the analysis, we find that there are some security problems in out-of-band network-based virtualization, for example the attacks to one server will do harm to the whole storage network. So we propose a secure system of storage virtualization based on trusted computing which ensures the whole storage network trusted with TPM. It introduces the risk evaluation mechanism to measure the integrity of servers. And then all the behaviors which operate storage network can be trusted. Meanwhile, it builds the trusted booting process in the virtualization controller and uses the log mechanism in servers. So the system can measure the integrity of servers through log reports.

AB  - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) is an emerging application for industrial automation. It is being widely used in critical infrastructure for monitoring and controlling the activities. The collaborative environment and interconnectivity of SCADA system needs communications and transmission of sensed real time data like status of machines, breaks and leakages in the system across various devices in the industrial plant. Such real time data provoke security breaches to SCADA systems and results in compromise of availability, integrity, confidentiality and trust relationship between the devices of SCADA systems. As the numbers of deliberate cyber attacks on these systems are increasing, providing a scheme to identify malicious activities and defend the attacks; thereby create secure environment for SCADA systems is an essential task. By considering constraints and efficiency requirements for such networks, we are proposing a scheme that uses Log to identify some malicious activities through continuous monitoring. In Log, we have only prioritized some parameters that help us to detect some vulnerable activities and at node level by using cooperative monitoring the nodes itself takes care of some attacks. In this new approach Log analysis for the identification of malicious activities is made using cluster based architecture. This work also considers the constraints of the SCADA system thereby providing an elegant identification of malicious activities for the current SCADA system.

AB  - There has been considerable success in developing strategies to detect insider threats in information systems based on what one might call the random object access model or ROA. This approach models illegitimate users as ones who randomly access records. The goal is to use statistics, machine learning, knowledge of workflows and other techniques to support an anomaly detection framework that finds such users. In this paper we introduce and study a random topic access model or RTA aimed at users whose access may be illegitimate but is not fully random because it is focused on common semantic themes. We argue that this model is appropriate for a meaningful range of attacks and develop a system based on topic summarization that is able to formalize the model and provide anomalous user detection effectively for it. To this end, we use healthcare as an example and propose a framework for evaluating the ability to recognize various types of random users called random topic access detection or RTAD. Specifically, we utilize a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for feature extraction, a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for outlier detection and evaluate the ability to identify different adversarial types. We validate the technique in the context of hospital audit logs where we show varying degrees of success based on user roles and the anticipated characteristics of attackers. In particular, it was found that RTAD exhibits strong performance for roles are described by a few topics, but weaker performance when users are more topic-agnostic.

AB  - Cloud Computing is a hot topic in the global IT industry, which is considered as the main part of the network and computing service provider in recent years. Some security issues will be more threatening in cloud computing, such as account theft and insider threat. We propose a framework to utilize anomaly detection and random re-sampling techniques for profiling user's behaviors via the frequent patterns of activated system processes. By utilizing the user profiles learned from normal data, our method can detect malicious activities and discriminate suspicious activities from different users. We use virtual machine (VM) to collect process log of normal users and malicious tools. The collected data is used on verifying if our method can detect the malicious activities on the system. The results show that all the malicious activities are detected with less than 4.6% false-positive rate. We also collect real-world data for testing the ability of discriminating activities collected from different users. The results showed that the user profiles can averagely detect 86% suspicious behaviors from different users with less than 1% false positive rate.

AB  - The evolution of wireless networks and mobile devices has resulted in increased concerns about performance and security of mobile payment systems. In this paper we propose SA2pMP, a lightweight secured architecture for two-party mobile payments. SA2pMP employs a lightweight cryptography scheme that combines public key and symmetric key cryptography systems (ECDSA and AES), as well as a multi-factor authentication mechanism. These are coupled with a transaction log strategy to satisfy the properties of confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation. We simulate SA2pMP in a context of money transfer banking transaction, on three different emulators:Sun Java Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2 for CLDC emulator, Sony Ericsson SDK 2.5.0.3 Z800 emulator, and Nokia S60 3rd Edition emulator. We also compare SA2pMP to some existing mobile payment platforms. The result of simulation and comparison proves that SA2pMP is a lightweight secured mechanism that is feasible and suitable for two-party mobile payment transactions, e.g. mobile banking, over Java ME enabled, resource-limited mobile devices.

AB  - Monitoring systems observe important information that could be a valuable resource to malicious users: attackers can use the knowledge of topology information, application logs, or configuration data to target attacks and make them hard to detect. The increasing need for correlating information across distributed systems to better detect potential attacks and to meet regulatory requirements can potentially exacerbate the problem if the monitoring is centralized. A single zero-day vulnerability would permit an attacker to access all information. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for performing policy-based security monitoring. We use policies to distribute information across several hosts, so that any host compromise has limited impact on the confidentiality of the data about the overall system. Experiments show that our solution spreads information uniformly across distributed monitoring hosts and forces attackers to perform multiple actions to acquire important data.

AB  - Being the core technology of IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud computing data center, server virtualization can virtualize servers with surplus resources to multiple virtual machines with diverse configurations according to users' demands. This can significantly improve the utilization of computing resources. Traditional intrusion detection techniques are no longer suitable for security detection of IaaS cloud computing data centers any more due to the specificity of IaaS architecture. Furthermore, most current intrusion detection systems (IDS) for cloud environment are provider-oriented. It's hard for IaaS users to obtain the statuses of virtual machines rented by them. In this paper, we designed a three-dimensional intrusion detection system (3D-IDS). Through a distributed collection of information on virtual machines, such as system logs, host behaviors and network behaviors, our system can synthesize related information to supply detailed security statuses of each virtual machine for IaaS users.

AB  - Hardware interlocks that enforce semantic invariants and allow fine-grained privilege separation can be built with reasonable costs given modern semiconductor technology. In the common error-free case, these mechanisms operate largely in parallel with the intended computation, monitoring the semantic intent of the computation on an operation-by-operation basis without sacrificing cycles to perform security checks. We specifically explore five mechanisms: (1) pointers with manifest bounds (fat pointers), (2) hardware types (atomic groups), (3) processor-supported authority, (4)authority-changing procedure calls (gates), and (5) programmable metadata validation and propagation (tags and dynamic tag management). These mechanisms allow the processor to continuously introspect on its operation, efficiently triggering software handlers on events that require logging, merit sophisticated inspection, or prompt adaptation. We present results from our prototype FPGA implementation of a processor that incorporates these mechanisms, quantifying the logic, memory, and latency requirements. We show that the dominant cost is the wider memory necessary to hold our metadata (the atomic groups and programmable tags), that the added logic resources make up less than 20% of the area of the processor, that the concurrent checks do not degrade processor cycle time, and that the tag cache is comparable to a small L1 data cache.

AB  - In this paper, online system-level self-healing support is presented for embedded systems. Different from off-line log analysis methods used by conventional intrusion detection systems, our research focuses on analyzing runtime kernel data structures hence perform self-diagnosis and self-healing. Inside the infrastructure, self-diagnosis and self-healing solutions have been implemented based on several selected critical kernel data structures. They can fully represent current system status and are also closely related with system resources. At runtime once any system inconsistency has been detected, predefined recovery functions are invoked. Our prototype is developed based on a lightweight virtual machine monitor, above on which the monitored Linux kernel, runtime detection and recovery services run simultaneously. The proposed infrastructure requires few modifications to current Linux kernel source code, thus it can be easily adopted into existing embedded systems. It is also fully software-based without introducing any specific hardware, therefore it is cost-efficient. The evaluation experiment results indicate that our prototype system can correctly detect inconsistent kernel data structures caused by security attacks with acceptable penalty to system performance.

AB  - Most statistical methods do not perfectly conform to real cases of cyber crimes. Consequently, using statistical methods to analyze intrusion logs in order to present evidentiary values in courts of law are often refuted as baseless and inadmissible evidences regardless of the input spent to generate the reports and whether the reports are well-grounded evidences or not. Sometimes, complainants are often bewildered and confused because it is almost certain that the prime suspects will be absolved in courts of law. These are tragic developments to computer security experts, corporate and private organizations that leverage on the usage of the Internet facilities to boost service delivery, business activities and profitability. Thus, this paper presents non-statistical metrics that adopt Serialization Modelling Method (S2M) to improve interpretations of intrusion logs. The approach instantiates tokens and serializes alerts triggered by Snort using well-defined values. Experiments illustrate that duplicate tokens or patterns of alerts that exhibit increased propensity are indicative of redundant alerts to a certain degree.

AB  - Honeypots are systems aimed at deceiving threat agents. In most of the cases the latter are cyber attackers with financial motivations, and malicious software with the ability to launch automated attacks. Honeypots are usually deployed as either production systems or as research units to study the methods employed by attackers. In this paper we present the results of two distinct research honeypots. The first acted as a malware collector, a device usually deployed in order to capture self-propagating malware and monitor their activity. The second acted as a decoy server, dropping but logging every malicious connection attempt. Both of these systems have remained online for a lengthy period of time to study the aforementioned malicious activity. During this assessment it was shown that human attackers and malicious software are constantly attacking servers, trying to break into systems or spread across networks. It was also shown that the usage of honeypots for malware monitoring and attack logging can be very effective and provide valuable data. Lastly, we present an open source visualization tool which was developed to help security professionals and researchers during the analysis and conclusion drawing phases, for use with one of the systems fielded in our study.

AB  - Advances in computer technologies facilitate the implementation of inter-organizational business processes. At the same time, managing the security of these processes is increasingly difficult. Compliance with high level specifcations, like normatives and pre-agreed protocols, rules and requirements, is difficult to validate. Here we discuss how Conformance Checking, a specific area of Process Mining, can be adapted for this purpose. Its role is to verify if an execution of a business process satisfies specifications represented by formal models (e.g. Petri Nets, Transition Systems, structures based on partial orders, etc). In the process mining literature, few efforts have been dedicated to online checking of business processes and choreographies for security purposes. The main requirement is high precision and reliability of event logs. They should record, precisely and unambiguously, all security-relevant activities of the analyzed process. Mantaining high-level logs becomes difficult with choreographies: log data are distributed, and must be related to events. Important metadata of event logs, like timestamps, can be ambiguous. Moreover, some data cannot be distributed due to security or privacy issues. These problems result in security-relevant ambiguities in event logs. Here we define a framework to create high-level event logs for online inter-organizational compliance checking using a Validation Authority. The system described here has been implemented in the issuing infrastructure for the Italian Electronic Identity card.

AB  - The authors address the issue of maintaining security in a fault-tolerant replicated database. They present a data-management protocol that integrates the information-dispersal algorithm (for security) and the quorum-consensus algorithm (for reliability). Although this protocol provides the desired level of security, it does not achieve the same level of availability for both read and write operations as the quorum-consensus algorithm. By integrating a log-based propagation mechanism with their protocol, the authors are able to achieve the same level of availability for both read and write operations as other quorum-consensus protocols, while maintaining the desired level of security

AB  - Data with high security requirements is being processed and stored with increasing frequency in the Cloud. To guarantee that the data is being dealt in a secure manner we investigate the applicability of Assurance methodologies. In a typical Cloud environment the setup of multiple layers and different stakeholders determines security properties of individual components that are used to compose Cloud applications. We present a methodology adapted from Common Criteria for aggregating information reflecting the security properties of individual constituent components of Cloud applications. This aggregated information is used to categorise overall application security in terms of Assurance Levels and to provide a continuous assurance level evaluation. It gives the service owner an overview of the security of his service, without requiring detailed manual analyses of log files.

AB  - Smart phones of today have increasingly sophisticated software. As the feature set grows further, the probability of system security related defects is likely to increase as well. Today, the security of mobile platforms and applications comes under great scrutiny as they are getting widely adopted. It is therefore crucial that code for mobile devices gets well tested and security bugs eliminated where possible. A popular and effective testing technique to identify severe security bugs in source code is fuzz testing. However, it is extremely time consuming to generate randomized input and test them on each version of the mobile phone and its software. This paper presents, MAFIA - Multi-target Automated Fuzzing Infrastructure and Arsenal, a composite, distributed client-server fuzz testing infrastructure for software applications and libraries in virtually any smartphone platform. The set of tools in MAFIA is file-format agnostic and can be used across various applications &amp; libraries. With MAFIA, we conducted a large number of tests against image-handling libraries and logged more than 13,000 mutated inputs that successfully crash several Symbian OS retail phones models. The system is scalable and can be easily extended to be used on new devices and operating systems.

AB  - The wave adoption of wireless over wire-line is a global phenomenon and the Oil &amp; Gas industry is no exception. This paper presents a multi-tiered secure hardened Wireless Remote Terminal Unit (WRTU) for SCADA systems. The WRTU is based on ARM Coter-M4 Processor supported by GSM &amp; Satellite modems, GPS, WiFi and Ethernet. WRTU can be interfaced to an array of standard industrial sensors, and actuators. WRTU has data acquisition, monitoring, and control capabilities. WRTU is an inexpensive device, using Commercial-of-The-Shelf (COTS) modules. WRTU is an easy to deploy (using existing public available infrastructure) device and `single device that does it all'. WRTU connects to the Control and Monitoring Centre (CMC) via GSM or Satellite modem. The CMC monitors and controls all peripherals of the WRTU, maintains a log of alerts, sensors information, set critical limits and provides geo-location of all WRTU s via its GIS portal. The CMC has a database to maintain all operational centric data, for report generation, historical analysis and forecasting. A multi-tiered cybersecurity framework has been designed to protect entire communication infrastructure. Cybersecurity is critically important for national security in todays connected world. Cybersecurity is of critical importance as most national security agencies want the introduction of cybersecurity into all new SCADA systems used in critical infrastructure.

AB  - Grid computing is becoming the prominent paradigm for resource exchange and collaboration, which are supported by dynamic, multi-institutional virtual organizations (VOs) overcoming limitations of time or space. As the de-facto standard for grid security, grid security infrastructure provides no effective mechanism to protect both resource providers and users from access of malicious entities. The trusted computing (TC) technology adopted by the trusted computing group (TCG) defines that an entity can be trusted as long as it always behaves in the expected manner. Specifically, the TC uses a hardware module called trusted platform module (TPM) to ensure the tamper-proof attestative behavior by integrity measurement, logging and report. In this paper, we propose and design a TC enabled system based on Linux and TPM hardware to enforce access control policy for the VO.

AB  - This paper addresses the issue of intrusion detection in database security management. A fuzzy adaptive resonance theory neural network and rule heuristics are used to build a model of company security judgment. The model is based on analysis of the log file of connections from the client side to the database of server side. The log file information includes user name, network address of client, the time of connection, the database name, the program used, and the protocol. Those features are inputted to a fuzzy adaptive resonance theory neural network for security judgment. An experiment using records from a local government office database indicates that our system has good results in detecting anomalous intrusions.

AB  - A new user-mode Linux based virtual honeynet architecture is presented in this paper. The new architecture has improved functionality that is difficult to realize in the GenII honeynet. Two new honeynet capabilities in particular are introduced. Honeypot controller is a new virtual honeynet component that assists in data control. The honeywall promises to have finer control over the honeypots through signal and system call redirections. The second new capability is the disk imager. The disk imager is capable of making forensic images of the virtual machine's file systems for further analysis. Since security for virtual honeynets is a big concern, the new virtual honeynet architecture utilizes security enhanced Linux to isolate the untrusted honeypots from the completely trusted honeywall. SELinux and other research work done in this field made the new honeynet architecture a viable alternative to GenII honeynets. A file system logging mechanism, FSLog, has been developed for the UML based virtual honeynet. In conjunction with the built-in tty logger, UML based honeynets have logging capabilities that are equivalent to their GenII honeynet counterparts. The current version of FSLog successfully logs eighteen virtual file systems system calls including the common, read(), write(), open() and close() functions. Its current functionality and how it pieces into the new architecture is also discussed. This work provides researchers with an alternative honeynet platform. The new virtual honeynet architecture is more portable, easier to setup, more cost effective and as secure as the GenII honeynet. The addition of the honeypot controller and disk imager components also makes the new virtual honeynet architecture more capable.

AB  - Customers always complain that anti-virus softwares bog down their computers by consuming much of PC memories and resources. With the popularity and variety of zero- day threats over the Internet, security companies have to keep on inserting new virus signatures into their databases. However, is the increasing size of the signature file the sole reason to drag computers to a crawl during the virus scan? This paper outlines other three reasons for slowing down software-protected computers, which actually are not directly related to the signature file. First, the rising time consumption of de-obfuscating binary payloads by using the emulation technology requires anti-virus softwares take more time to scan a packed file than an unpacked file. Second, new technology file system causes self-similarity in file index searching and data block accessing. Even if file sizes fit the log-normal distribution, there are still many "spikes" of high virus-scanning latency which cannot be ignored. Last but not least, temporal changes in file size, file type, and storage capacity in modern operation systems are slowing down virus scan. The paper also discusses the cloud-based security infrastructure for deploying a light-weight and fast anti-virus products.

AB  - Web applications offer business and convenience services that society has become dependent on, such as online banking. Success of these applications is dependent on end user trust, although these services have serious weaknesses that can be exploited by attackers. Application owners must take additional steps to ensure the security of customer data and integrity of the applications, since web applications are under siege from cyber criminals seeking to steal confidential information and disable or damage the services offered by these applications. Successful attacks have lead to some organizations experiencing financial difficulties or even being forced out of business. Organizations have insufficient tools to detect and respond to attacks on web applications, since traditional security logs have gaps that make attack reconstruction nearly impossible. This paper explores network recording challenges, benefits and possible future use. A network recording solution is proposed to detect and capture SQL injection attacks, resulting in the ability to successfully reconstruct SQL injection attacks in order to maintain application integrity.

AB  - The problem of security in communication has been researched to ad hoc network in this paper, and it also has been proposed a distributed intrusion detection model which is based on the fuzzy judgment. The judging rules of the aggressive behavior are summarized in this model according to the different offensive features in routing layer. Moreover, the log is established according to IP packets in routing layer, and the fuzzy evaluation to the data is carried on. On the base of this, a way to enhance the correct rate of the detection by joint detection mechanism of multi-point cooperation has been introduced in this paper. To distribute the network resource dynamically and reasonably, all nodes are treated dynamically with safety classification. Taking AODV routing protocol as an example, the working mechanism of the model is introduced, and the software NS2 is used to put up network simulation platform. The experimental results show that the detection model can guarantee the network security better.

AB  - The development of dependable mobile P2P systems is an inherently challenging task since such systems may operate in largely uncontrolled environments and may engage new peers or lose existing ones without any form of centralised control. In these circumstances, dependability and security can be enhanced through the runtime monitoring (a.k.a. dynamic verification) of the compliance of the system behaviour against specific dependability and security properties and the execution of control in cases where properties are violated. In this paper we present a framework for the dynamic verification and control of mobile P2P systems, which uses peer-specific monitoring policies to specify application-level properties. The deployment of this framework for monitoring system behaviour adds an extra layer of security and dependability checking, which is independent from checks performed directly by the P2P system that is being monitored. Thus, it makes the system more fault-tolerant and enables event logging that could be used for further analysis and prevention of attacks.

AB  - The deep study of anomaly feature based on the particular server was made in this paper. By continuously monitoring on the honeypot deployed in Internet Data Center for more than two months, the experimental results were summarized and some initial exploratory models were built. The models show that the number of attackers for the main attack types and ports can be described by normal distribution; meanwhile, the average packet number that each attacker generates per day can be described by log-normal distribution. This research aims to contribute to endeavor in the wider security research community to build methods and obtain some statistical models, grounded on strong empirical work, for assessment of the robustness of systems in hostile environments, and the anomaly traffic sampling, detection and classification on the backbone.

AB  - With the rapid development of information technology and Internet, the mass data storage of Internet is an urgent problem to be solved. Due to the insufficiency of single NameNode, a new improved data storage method based on HDFS was proposed. In this method, consistent hashing strategy was adopted for metadata allocation; NameNode clusters were built and BLT was used for management of NameNode mapping; log copy was used to achieve data security and consistency. Simulation results showed that the method can effectively improve read and write performance under ensuring metadata's security, consistency and fault tolerance.

AB  - Data stored in the P2P data grids are replicated at peers to achieve good query latency, low communication cost, and high availability. However, replication also raises consistency issues, which should be well defined and carefully maintained to facilitate better user collaboration. Epidemic algorithms were designed to satisfy a level of consistency weaker than serializability but preserve the causal order of update operations or transactions. However, with large system scale and with high access concurrency, epidemic lazy update algorithms can also introduce system delusion (e.g., with too many conflicting update or read transactions, system cannot reach consistency that there is no way to repair by reconciling conflicting transactions), which is due to their lazy update nature. Also, in P2P systems, some peers may be malicious because of being compromised, thus, security is a critical issue that should be addressed. In this paper, we propose an update mechanism to limit system delusion while providing high access concurrency. A two-level vector clock is developed to maintain the causal order of transactions in the data grid and maintain the consistency of peers with transaction logs. Security protocol is designed and integrated into the update mechanism to address the security issues.

AB  - The development and the wide spread use of web services allow for convenient electronic data storage and distribution all over the world. As this web services is a new service-oriented computing paradigm which poses the unique security challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, multi-domain characteristic and highly dynamic nature. A key challenge in Web services security is to design effective access control schemes. However, most current access control systems base authorization decisions on subjectpsilas identity. In this paper, we suggest web access control scheme which incorporating user password and web server log. The major objective of the proposed model is to provide mechanisms to allow control of web user access based on the user access behavior by tracking the web access history. The system controls access to web pages depending on user password, date of last request, page visited (URL) and status action. The active userpsilas access pattern is matched with user access data discovered from user access history, based on mining web usage data using association rules mining and PrefixSpan algorithms, then analyzed to make the access control decision (web access is permitted or denied).

AB  - The VisAlert visual correlation tool facilitates situational awareness in complex network environments by providing a holistic view of network security to help detect malicious activities. Information visualization techniques and methods in many applications have effectively increased operators' situational awareness, letting them more effectively detect, diagnose, and treat anomalous conditions. Visualization elevates information comprehension by fostering rapid correlation and perceived associations. Our visualization technique integrates the information in log and alert files into an intuitive, flexible, extensible, and scalable visualization tool - VisAlert - that presents critical information concerning network activity in an integrated manner, increasing the user's situational awareness.

AB  - The increasing use of intrusion detection system gives rise to a huge volume of alert logs, making it hard for security administrators to uncover hidden attack scenarios. In this paper, we propose a four-layer semantic scheme designed to allow inferring attack scenarios and enabling attack semantic queries. The modified case grammar, PCTCG, is used to convert the raw alerts into machine-understandable uniform alert streams. The 2-atom alert semantic network, 2-AASN are used to generate attack scenario classes. Afterwards, based on the alert context, attack scenario instances are extracted and attack semantic query results on attack scenario instances using spreading activation technique are forwarded to the security administrator.

AB  - Systems for information commerce on the WWW have to support flexible business models if they are to cover the wide range of requirements that are imposed by the different types of information businesses. This leads to non-trivial functional and security requirements both on the provider side and on the consumer side, for which we introduce an architecture and a system implementation called webXice (Web-enabled eXtended Information and Content Exchange protocol). We focus on the question of how participants with minimal technological requisites, i.e. with just standard Web browsers available, can be technologically enabled to participate in the information commerce at a system level, while not sacrificing the functionality and security required by an autonomous participant in an information commerce scenario. In particular, we propose an implementation strategy to efficiently support persistent message logging for lightweight clients, which enables the clients to collect and manage non-reputable messages as proofs. We believe that the capability to support minimal system platforms is a necessary pre-condition for the widespread use of any information commerce infrastructure.

AB  - Operating system debugging and system security are two important issues which are attracted more and more attentions. However, traditional solutions of software debugging can not make an integrated replay towards the status of operating system. Moreover, most intrusion detection methods all depend on the operating system excessively, but operating system ex-poses so many interfaces to outside that it can not ensure its own security and is attacked vulnerably. Therefore, a para-virtualized model based full system replay is developed in this paper. According to the para-virtualized device model pro-vided by Xen, this system captures the non-deterministic events in the target operating system through a real-time monitoring module, and saves the data and time point of these events occurrence as log file elaborately. Using these data, we can make a full-system replay to the target operating system accurately. Compared with the previous replay systems, this system is more efficient and has two prominent advantages: no need to modify the target operating system, and no need to reboot the target operating system before executing replay.

AB  - Neural networks approach is one of the most promising methodologies for intrusion detection in network security. An integrated intrusion detection system (IIDS) scheme based on multiple neural networks is proposed. The approaches used in IIDS include principal component neural networks, growing neural gas networks and principal component self-organizing map networks. By the abilities of classification and clustering analysis of the above methods, IIDS can be adapted to both anomaly and misuse detections for intrusive outsiders. The training stage is a mixture of supervised manner and unsupervised one. Furthermore, IIDS uses the buffering and spoofing principles of address resolution protocol (ARP) to capture and refuse the insider intruders trying to log on a local area network (LAN). Therefore, IIDS is able to detect the intrusions/attacks both from the outer Internet and an inner LAN. Experiments are carried out to illustrate the performance of the proposed intrusion detection system by using the KDD CUP 1999 Intrusion Detection Evaluation dataset.

AB  - With the increasing development of electronic commerce application, electronic commerce system security is facing the heavy challenge. To arrive at the goal of intensifying the behavior trustworthiness and controllability of electronic commerce systems, we focus on building the trustworthy model between electronic commerce system and user behaviors and strengthening the manageability of electronic commerce systems. By setting up the trustworthy computing circumstance and supplying the trustworthy validation and the active protection based on identity and behavior for trustworthy electronic commerce system, we may defend the unaware viruses and intrusion. Furthermore, the controllability of behavior trust is studied. It can be predicted trust level under the multi-trust- attribute conditions. The experiment results show the .NET Framework of creating user behavior log to provide evidences for behavior trust forecast and control. The Multi-tiered Distributed architecture based on Ajax and .Net is built to realize the content mentioned above and applied to the practical project.

AB  - Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful to- ols for automated intrusion analysis.

AB  - Unusual behaviour detection and information extraction in streams of short documents and files (emails, news, tweets, log files, messages, etc.) are important problems in security applications. In [1], [2], a new approach to rapid change detection and automatic summarization of large documents was introduced. This approach is based on a theory of social networks and ideas from image processing and especially on the Helmholtz Principle from the Gestalt Theory of human perception. In this article we modify, optimize and verify the approach from [1], [2] to unusual behaviour detection and information extraction from small documents.

AB  - Internet users today often have usernames and passwords at multiple web sites. To simplify things, many sites support some form of federated identity management, such as OpenID, that enables users to have a single account that allows them to log on to many different sites by authenticating to a single identity provider. Most identity providers perform authentication using a username and password. Should these credentials be compromised, e.g. captured by a key logger or malware on an untrusted computer, all the user's accounts become compromised. Therefore a more secure authentication method is desirable. We have implemented 2-clickAuth, an optical challenge-response solution where a web camera and a camera phone are used for authentication. Two-dimensional barcodes are used for the communication between phone and computer, which allows 2-clickAuth to transfer relatively large amounts of data in a short period of time. 2-clickAuth is considerably more secure than passwords while still being easy to use and easy to distribute to users. This makes 2-clickAuth a viable alternative to passwords in systems where enhanced security is desired, but availability, ease-of-use, and cost cannot be compromised. We have implemented an identity provider in the OpenID federated identity management system that uses 2-clickAuth for authentication, making 2-clickAuth available to all users of sites that support OpenID, including Facebook, Sourceforge and MySpace.

AB  - With the increasing development of distributed system application, distributed system security is facing the heavy challenge. To arrive at the goal of intensifying the behavior trustworthiness and controllability of distributed systems, we focus on building the trustworthy model between distributed system and user behaviors and strengthening the manageability of distributed systems. By setting up the trustworthy computing circumstance and supplying the trustworthy validation and the active protection based on identity and behavior for trustworthy distributed system, we may defend the unaware viruses and intrusion. Furthermore, the controllability of behavior trust is studied. It can be predicted trust level under the multi-trust-attribute conditions. The experiment results show the .NET framework of creating user behavior log to provide evidences for behavior trust forecast and control.

AB  - A reexamination is made of the problem of protecting sensitive data in an <e1>n</e1> by <e1>n</e1> table of integer statistics, when the nonsensitive data are made public along with the row and column sums for the table. Consideration is given to the problem of computing the tightest upper bounds on the values of sensitive (undisclosed) cells. These bounds, together with tightest lower bounds (which can be efficiently computed), define precisely the smallest intervals that an adversary can deduce for the missing sensitive cell values. Small intervals compromise the security of the undisclosed data, and in some cases violate laws on public data disclosure. It is observed that the number of initial needed bounds can be reduced from <e1>O</e1>(<e1>n</e1> log <e1>n</e1>) to 2<e1>n</e1>-1 by exploiting a recent result of C.K. Cheung and T.C. Hu (1988)

AB  - Network accountability and forensic analysis have become increasingly important, as a means of performing network diagnostics, identifying malicious nodes, enforcing trust management policies, and imposing diverse billing over the Internet. This has led to a series of work to provide better network support for accountability, and efficient mechanisms to trace packets and information flows through the Internet. In this paper, we make the following contributions. First, we show that network accountability and forensic analysis can be posed generally as data provenance computations and queries over distributed streams. In particular, one can utilize declarative networks with appropriate security and provenance extensions to provide a unified declarative framework for specifying, analyzing and auditing networks. Second, we propose a taxonomy of data provenance along multiple axes, and show that they map naturally to different use cases in networks. Third, we suggest techniques to efficiently compute and store network provenance, and provide an initial performance evaluation on the P2 declarative networking system with modifications to support authenticated communication and provenance.

AB  - Rural Internet kiosks in developing countries can cost-effectively provide communication and e-governance services to the poorest sections of society. Unfortunately, a variety of technical and non-technical issues have caused most kiosk deployments to be unsustainable. KioskNet addresses the key technical problems underlying kiosk failure by using robust dasiamechanical backhaulpsila for connectivity, and by using low-cost and reliable kiosk controllers to support services delivered from one or more recycled PCs. KioskNet also addresses related issues such as security, user management, and log collection. In this paper, we describe the KioskNet system and outline its hardware, software, and security architectures. We describe a pilot deployment, and how we used lessons from this deployment to re-design our initial prototype.

AB  - In this paper, an extension of CPT scheme (CPTE for short) is introduced. In watermarking area, this is a block-based approach. Given a binary image B, in each block F of a size mÃn of B, by CPT scheme, ones can embed r = Round(log<sub>2</sub>(m.n+1)) bits by changing at most two entries of F. In our CPTE scheme, r = Round(log<sub>2</sub>(m.n)) + 1 bits can be embedded by changing at most two entries of F, too. That means, in most cases, the number of embedded bits given by our CPTE scheme is larger than that by CPT scheme one bit. As a consequence, we establish a new modified scheme-MCPTE based on CPTE scheme to control the quality for security of the embedded blocks, in the same way due to [Tseng-Pan, 2001]. Experimental results show that in general, MCPTE scheme gives more embedded bits than those by Tseng-Pan' scheme, while the quality is the same.

In this paper, DSC principles are used to secure biometric data in a multimodal hand-based recognition system, introducing a novel approach for Log-Likelihood Ratio initialization and a new binarization technique. The proposed biometric recognition system relies on a new architecture using three hand-based biometric traits: palmprint, finger surface and hand geometry, being the latter used as a soft biometric to accelerate the identification process. Promising results are achieved in terms of recognition accuracy, speed and security when performing identification on large databases, like the UST Hand Image Database.

AB  - A connection-chain is a set of connections created by sequentially logging into a series of hosts, known as stepping-stones. It provides an effective scheme for attackers to manually interact with a victim machine without disclosing their true origin. The victim will only identify the last host in the chain, while the true origin is hidden behind a series of stepping-stones. Addressing connection-chains poses challenges for researchers in the field of computer security. Accordingly, several approaches have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we review those approaches and classify them according to a proposed taxonomy.

AB  - We report experiences with constraint-based whitebox fuzz testing in production across hundreds of large Windows applications and over 500 machine years of computation from 2007 to 2013. Whitebox fuzzing leverages symbolic execution on binary traces and constraint solving to construct new inputs to a program. These inputs execute previously uncovered paths or trigger security vulnerabilities. Whitebox fuzzing has found one-third of all file fuzzing bugs during the development of Windows 7, saving millions of dollars in potential security vulnerabilities. The technique is in use today across multiple products at Microsoft. We describe key challenges with running whitebox fuzzing in production. We give principles for addressing these challenges and describe two new systems built from these principles: SAGAN, which collects data from every fuzzing run for further analysis, and JobCenter, which controls deployment of our whitebox fuzzing infrastructure across commodity virtual machines. Since June 2010, SAGAN has logged over 3.4 billion constraints solved, millions of symbolic executions, and tens of millions of test cases generated. Our work represents the largest scale deployment of whitebox fuzzing to date, including the largest usage ever for a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver. We present specific data analyses that improved our production use of whitebox fuzzing. Finally we report data on the performance of constraint solving and dynamic test generation that points toward future research problems.

AB  - Cloud Computing, the next generation of Internet-based services, will allow cost-effective outsourcing of applications and business processes. However, outsourcing business processes to potentially untrusted servers poses significant security and privacy problems. Despite having no direct control over the hardware platform on which the business processes run, clients still need to obtain assurance of correct execution. In this paper, we propose an architecture based on Trusted Computing technologies that allows fine-granular and policy-based remote attestation of outsourced business processes running on remote hosts. In particular, we let the provider generate, during execution of the business process, secure execution logs that allow to verify correct execution of the process at a later time by the client. Our architecture allows a cloud provider to host business processes for multiple tenants, considering at the same time multi-instance processes. We show how such an architecture can be implemented using Trusted Computing technologies, traditional virtualization technologies like Xen and the ODE process engine.

AB  - Today, companies have turned to use fraud detection methods to reduce their financial losses that have been arisen in this way. Thus, Process aware information systems are vulnerable to insider frauds. Flexibility in these systems gives the opportunity for fraudsters to commit illegal activities. Strict security controls on these systems at runtime reduces their flexibility. Moreover, the frequent changes in these systems make inefficient the ordinary fraud detection methods and it remains as a challenge for organizations. In this paper, we propose a new fraud detection method that uses both statistical information about system's log and process model mined from it to detect fraudulent instances. Our method reduces false positive rate and supports loop, parallel and selection structures in processes. The experimental results show effectiveness of the approach as it represents value of more than 0.8 for F-measure.

AB  - The concept of a zero-knowledge protocol has led to the consideration of the feasibility of implementing a secure password protocol, one that does not involve the transmission of any information concerning the password during the logon process. The authors have constructed a demonstration of the feasibility of the use of such a model, and describe a number of instances in which the zero-knowledge protocol model could practically be used for greater operating system security. The protocol was executed on a Sun-3, model 110, using a number of different values for the size of the secret and also for the number of iterations. It is shown that values of the pair (log <e1>p</e1>,<e1>n</e1>) approximating (60,35) can run in approximately five minutes on currently available workstations

AB  - Immunology inspired computer security has attracted enormous attention as its potential impacts on the next generation service-oriented network operation system. In this paper, we propose a new agent-based threat awareness assessment strategy inspired by the human immune system to dynamically adapt against attacks. Specifically, this approach is based on the dynamic reconfiguration of the file access right for system calls or logs (e.g., file rewritability) with balanced adaptability and vulnerability. Based on an information-theoretic analysis on the coherently associations of adaptability, autonomy as well as vulnerability, a generic solution is suggested to break down their coherent links. The principle is to maximize context-situation awared systems' adaptability and reduce systems' vulnerability simultaneously. Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed biological behaviour-inspired vulnerability awareness system.

AB  - Accountability implies that any entity should be held responsible for its own specific action or behavior so that the entity is part of larger chains of accountability. One of the goals of accountability is that once an event has transpired, the events that took place are traceable so that the causes can be determined afterward. The poor accountability provided by today's computers and networks wastes a great deal of money and effort; examples include activities to identify whether a system is under reconnaissance or attack, and the difficulties of distinguishing legitimate emails from phishing attacks. This is due to the simple fact that today's computing and network infrastructure was not built with accountability in mind. In this article we propose a novel methodology called flow-net for accountability. We apply this methodology to media access control and routing layers in wireless networks. We then compare the performance of flow-net with audit log files. This article presents a novel approach for traffic data collection that can also be used for forensics and intrusion detection purposes.

AB  - All too often, decisions about whom to trust in computer systems are driven by the needs of system management rather than data security. In particular data storage is often entrusted to people who have no role in creating or using the data-through outsourcing of data management, hiring of outside consultants to administer servers, or even collocation servers in physically insecure machine rooms to gain better network, connectivity. This paper outlines the design of SUNDR, a network file system designed to run on untrusted servers. SUNDR servers can safely be managed by people who have no permission to read or write data stored in the file system. Thus, people can base their trust decisions on who needs to use data and their administrative decisions on how best to manage the data. Moreover, with SUNDR, attackers will no longer be able to wreak havoc by compromising servers and tampering with data. They will need to compromise clients while legitimate users are logged on. Since clients do not need to accept incoming network connections, they can more easily be firewalled and protected from compromise than servers.

Environment is heterogeneous, and constantly adding new systems including Cloud. Our solution offers a platform where a user gets an individual user ID on a system - but only if they need it, when they need it, for only as long as they need it . Reusable ID scheme reduces the number of IDs in the system yielding cost savings on lifecycle management activities, improved security compliance . A compliance readiness platform can be enabled to prevent, flag, or monitor questionable access in or near real-time . Provide easily accessible logs to prove compliance policies.

AB  - Healthcare systems are being extended to monitor patients with body sensors wirelessly linked to a mobile phone that interacts with remote healthcare services and staff. As such systems become more widespread, with multiple healthcare providers and security domains, the establishment of trust between users, providers and medical staff will become important. In this paper we implement the ETTG privacy-preserving trust negotiation protocol and show how it can be used to automatically establish mutual trust between interacting parties in compliance with access-control and disclosure policies. The protocol is implemented in Java and can be run on J2ME platforms. The trust negotiation steps are logged and the resulting trust graphs can be visualised to show how policy compliance was achieved. We also develop a new easier-to-understand syntax for ETTG and use it to define access-control and disclosure policies for a small pervasive healthcare scenario

AB  - Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offers immense advantages to a subscriber, as the SaaS subscriber pays for the amount of service he has consumed. This pay-per-use model offered by the SaaS provider is supported by the underlying virtualization technology, which allows sharing of the physical infrastructure among several clients who subscribe to the SaaS cloud to optimize the cost of usage. However, with this cost-benefit come several risks related to reliability, security and availability (RAS). Consequently, a potential subscriber of a SaaS offering wants to perform several reviews and validations related to RAS before the subscription. In fact, the subscriber often prefers an independent validation of these QoS aspects, as an on-going basis. In this work, we propose a validation methodology and a tool iCirrus-Val for a SaaS subscriber, to perform an independent analysis and verification of functional errors and vulnerabilities of a SaaS cloud from its weblogs. iCirrus-Val groups the logged URLs into whitelist and suspect categories. A whitelisted URL belonging to a business process, is analyzed for permanent and transient faults. A suspect URL is further analyzed to check if it falls into an &#x201C;attempt to an attack category&#x201D;. Our approach is lightweight and does not require data from other parts of the system that is typically unavailable to a SaaS subscriber. It is restricted to a study of RAS from the subscribers entry point. However, we believe that our approach has a potential to identify a large number of the vulnerabilities. Our belief, though not empirically validated here, rests upon recent research findings which indicate that vulnerabilities are increasingly targeted at the entry point such as the web server, as attackers find it difficult to hack the core server.We illustrate our approach using a real-life data of an organization that has adopted a SaaS public cloud.

AB  - An increasing number of security incidents on industrial control systems drew a lot of concerns lately. Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.

AB  - Multi-level data on land and resource plays an increasingly important role in the development of Land and Resource E-government. In view of data security, there must be physical isolation between intranet and extranet of Land and Resource E-government of governments at all levels, therefore, it reduces officials' efficiency to a certain extent, especially for those on a business trip. Multi-level data exchange mechanism aiming at sharing of data between intranet and extranet is strongly demanded as the rapid development of network service. This paper divides multi-level data on land and resource into two categories: spatial data and government affairs information. We concern with data exchange mechanism mainly in the respect of government affairs information which is considered as an absolute solution to improvement of officials' efficiency. This paper expounds that the design philosophy of data exchange mechanism based on XML technology is representation of data into XML document. The purpose of the research is to establish data exchange mechanism not only sharing of government affairs information between intranet and extranet but also ensuring data security of Land and Resource E-government. After deeply studying data exchange theories, we propose a development plan based on middleware including three functional modules: data extraction module, middleware indication module indicated by ConfigurationXML document and DataXML document and data storage module. In this paper, data exchange mechanism has been applied in Hubei Province Land and Resource E-government System which is proved in practice as a kind of effective assistance and polish to the system mainly in terms of processing business. In addition, data exchange mechanism used digital certificates technology and the method of tracking security log to assure data security.

AB  - This paper describes a turnkey solution to add a XML digital signature capability without modifying existing XML-based B2B systems. The signature proxy between applications watches for XML messages exchanged on the network. Outbound messages are received by the proxy and automatically signed and by a signature server implemented as a Web service. Inbound messages are also verified by using the proxy and the signature server The existing applications do not care about handling of digital signatures. The signature server can also provide (1) content-based key selection and (2) logging of signed documents with fine-grain access control. The system introduced in this paper is called the XML Security Services Suite (XS-Cube), a set of security-related Web services including digital signatures

AB  - The current state of affairs regarding the way events are logged by IT systems is the source of many problems for the developers of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. These problems stand in the way of the development of more accurate security solutions that draw their results from the data included within the logs they process. This is mainly caused by a lack of standards that can encapsulate all events in a coherent way. As a result, correlating between logs produced by different systems that use different log formats has been difficult and infeasible in many cases. In order to solve the challenges faced by Correlation Based Intrusion Detection Systems, we provide a platform for normalising events1 into a unified super event loosely based on the Common Event Expression standard (CEE) developed by the Mitre corporation. We show how our solution is able to normalise seemingly unrelated events into a unified format. Additionally, we demonstrate queries that can detect attacks on collections of normalised logs from different sources.

AB  - To defend against various attacks, many security systems such as intrusion detection systems are deployed into hosts and networks to better protect digital assets. However, there are well-known problems related to the current intrusion detection systems. To better understand security threats from various sources and take appropriate response, it is necessary to perform alert correlation. This paper proposes a general alert correlation architecture, including four important components: log management, alert correlation, incident response and knowledge base system. The focus is to describe most important operations in alert correlation component. The proposed architecture includes anomaly-based analysis in alert correlation component. Different techniques for alert correlation are reviewed and compared. This study proposes that a hybrid model of multiple techniques leads to better performance of alert correlation engine.

We present a framework that allows conducting research on anonymity techniques in a real-life environment using smartphones. The proposed solution also includes logging mechanisms that facilitate positioning research dataset development in open format. To present the capabilities of the solution, we deliver the concept of K-anonymity to protect mobile users that issue queries to location-based services. Experimental evaluation of the solution includes development of real-life logging dataset using smartphones by volunteers. Different flavours of anonymity algorithms are easy to be included and tested. The solution has received encouraging feedback and successfully assists the researchers of location based services to experiment, validate and develop their techniques in real life environment.

AB  - SSH services are run on many hosts with various scopes other than just operation, so dictionary attack against the service is a common security threat. SANS has reported the emergence of distributed SSH dictionary attacks, which are very stealthy in comparison with a simple one. Since even one success of such an attack causes serious problems, administrators should implement countermeasures. SSH dictionary attacks have been detected in two basic ways that rely on either log files or network traffic. Both approaches, however, have limitations. The first approach imposes upon administrators heavy maintenance costs, which grow linearly with the number of hosts in networks. The second approach cannot distinguish between successful and unsuccessful attacks. Of more immediate concern, neither approach is effective against stealthy attacks because the login attempts of these attacks have little impact on log files or network traffic. An ideal method would be able to detect individual attacks and distinguish between an attack's success or failure, using information derived from only network traffic. In this paper, we describe such a method, which was developed by combining two novel elements. First, on the basis of our assumptions, we use two criteria: "existence of a connection protocol" and "difference in the inter-arrival time of an auth-packet". These criteria are not available, though, owing to the confidentiality and flexibility of the SSH protocol. Second, we resolve this problem by identifying transition points of a sub-protocol through flow features and machine learning algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments on real traffic traces collected at the edge in our campus networks. The experimental results are encouraging for this research direction, though they are derived from reduced datasets of SSH dictionary attacks and under simplifying assumptions. The significant contribution is the demonstration that an ideal metho- for detecting SSH dictionary attacks seems feasible.

AB  - In the past few years, IRC bots, malicious programs which are remotely controlled by attackers through IRC servers, have become a major threat to the Internet and for users. These bots can be used in different malicious ways such as issuing distributed denial of services attacks to shut down other networks and services, keystrokes logging, spamming, traffic sniffing cause serious disruption on networks and users. New bots use peer to peer (P2P) protocols start to appear as the upcoming threat to Internet security due to the fact that P2P bots do not have a centralized point to shutdown or trace back, thus making the detection of P2P bots is a real challenge. In response to these threats, we present an algorithm to detect an individual P2P bot running on a system by correlating its activities. Our evaluation shows that correlating different activities generated by P2P bots within a specified time period can detect these kind of bots.

These low-level events are produced unintentionally by the user during interaction with different software applications during pursuit of some, potentially mischievous, high level goals. This paper concentrates on the review and analysis of indirect human computer interaction-based biometrics frequently used in intrusion detection systems. We conclude with an experimental demonstration of an intrusion detection system based on network traffic analysis as an example of application of indirect human computer interaction-based behavioral biometrics.

AB  - The advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is a crucial component of the smart grid, replacing traditional analog devices with computerized smart meters. Smart meters have not only allowed for efficient management of many end-users, but also have made AMI an attractive target for remote exploits and local physical tampering with the end goal of stealing energy. While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior. Our experimental results on normal and anomalous load profiles show that AMIDS can identify energy theft efforts with high accuracy. Furthermore, AMIDS correctly identified legitimate load profile changes that more elementary analyses classified as malicious.

On the other hand, administrators are competing with the flood of logs every day, and chasing for the updates on a new kind of attacks. Given the overwhelming tasks of administrators, it is extremely hard to keep the peace without the help of professionals such as hired system administrators and security analysts. In this paper, we propose an alarm annunciator to analyze system. We constructed the system that detects a large-scale brute-force attack and warns administrating PCs, as a prototype of the system that collects and analyzes logs, and alerts system administrators automatically. The alarm annunciator enables variety of domain administrators to manage their domains and servers with the minimum effort and expense.

AB  - Automatic Fingerprint Recognition Systems (AFRSs) rely on minutiae position and orientation within the fingerprint image for matching. Minutiae information is highly accurate provided that the fingerprint image matched is of high quality. However, this is not always the case because of diseases and hash working conditions that affect fingerprints. In order to maintain high level of security independent of varying fingerprint image quality research suggests the use of other fingerprint features to compliment minutiae. These are things like ridge contours, sweat pores, dots, and incipient ridges. Sweat pores have been proven as one of the most distinctive among these feature. Thus in order to improve accuracy of AFRSs pores can be fused with minutiae or used alone. Sweat pores have been less utilized in the past due to constraints imposed by fingerprint scanning devices and resolution standards. Recently, progress has been made on both scanning devices and resolution standards to support the use of pores in AFRSs. However, very few techniques exist for extracting, matching and fusing them with minutiae. Matching and fusion can only be possible if pores are available. Some techniques have been proposed to reliable extract pores. However, existing techniques can only work on one resolution i.e. an algorithm proposed and tested on 500dpi cannot work on 1000dpi without minor modifications because pores size change if resolution changes. In addition, existing pore extraction techniques are computationally expensive. In this paper an algorithm to extract feature level 3 (pores) is proposed. The algorithm uses Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) in Fourier domain in order to reduce computation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on two distinct databases with different resolutions in order to validate its accuracy. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is further measured using false detection rate (FDR) and true detection rate (TDR). Results show that FDR ranges - rom 10-35% while TDR ranges from 65-90%.

AB  - Denial of service attacks constitute one of the greatest problem in network security. Monitoring traffic is one of the main techniques used in order to find out the existence of possible outliers in the traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose an approach that detects denial of service attacks using emergent self-organizing maps. The approach is based on classifying "normal" traffic against "abnormal" traffic in the sense of denial of service attacks. The approach permits the automatic classification of events that are contained in logs and visualization of network traffic. Extensive simulations show the effectiveness of this approach compared to previously proposed approaches regarding false alarms and detection probabilities

AB  - Honeypot is an effective security tool, which is intended to be attacked and compromised to gain more information about the attacker and his attack techniques. To study these attacks, the honeypot must capture and log large amounts of data which are very difficult to process manually. So, the analysis of these logs has become a very difficult and time consuming task. To resolve this problem, several researchers have proposed the use of data mining techniques in order to classify logged traffic and extract useful information. In this paper, we present a data analysis tool for our Honeypot Router. This tool is based on data mining clustering. The main idea is to extract useful features from data captured by the Honeypot Router. These data will be then clustered by using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm in order to classify the captured packets and extract those that are suspicious. Suspicious packets will be then verified by a human expert. This solution is very useful to detect novel routing attacks.

AB  - Independence is a fundamental property needed to achieve security in fault-tolerant distributed computing. In practice, distributed communication networks are neither fully synchronous or fully asynchronous, but rather loosely synchronized. By this, we mean that in a communication protocol, messages at a given round may depend on messages from other players at the same round. These possible dependencies among messages create problems if we need n players to announce independently chosen values. This task is called simultaneous broadcast. In this paper, we present the first constant round protocol for simultaneous broadcast in a reasonable computation model (which includes a common shared random string among the players). The protocol is provably secure under general cryptographic assumptions. In the process, we develop a new and stronger formal definition for this problem. Previously known protocols for this task required either O(log n) or expected constant rounds to complete (depending on the computation model considered)

AB  - We present the design, security proof, and implementation of an anonymous subscription service. Users register for the service by providing some form of identity, which might or might not be linked to a real-world identity such as a credit card, a web login, or a public key. A user logs on to the system by presenting a credential derived from information received at registration. Each credential allows only a single login in any authentication window, or epoch. Logins are anonymous in the sense that the service cannot distinguish which user is logging in any better than random guessing. This implies unlinkability of a user across different logins. We find that a central tension in an anonymous subscription service is the service provider's desire for a long epoch (to reduce server-side computation) versus users' desire for a short epoch (so they can repeatedly "re-anonymize" their sessions). We balance this tension by having short epochs, but adding an efficient operation for clients who do not need unlinkability to cheaply re-authenticate themselves for the next time period. We measure performance of a research prototype of our protocol that allows an independent service to offer anonymous access to existing services. We implement a music service, an Android-based subway-pass application, and a web proxy, and show that adding anonymity adds minimal client latency and only requires 33 KB of server memory per active user.

AB  - Nowadays, enterprises across all branches and sectors face a new hype regarding &#x201C;Big Data&#x201D;. Thus, new requirements in the context of Business Intelligence emerge. Big Data demands to process vast amounts of unstructured data from social networks, sensor data, etc. in near real-time. In order to tackle these challenges, current research works aim to develop new ways of data storage and analysis from a database point of view. This is the advent of so-called &#x201C;In-Memory&#x201D; databases (e.g. SAP HANA) that hold entire data volumes in their fast RAM memory and use hard disks only for logging or archiving purposes. Another promising technology with respect to this topic is "Cloud Computing". Storing and analyzing vast amounts of heterogeneous data require appropriate underlying hardware infrastructures. Obtaining such hardware capabilities form external cloud providers is an auspicious way to avoid expensive investments in new hardware. However, using external hardware resources from the public cloud always means that crucial data has to leave the internal enterprise network and enterprises have to trust external providers. Bringing "Big Data" into the cloud, our approach follows the principle of vertically distributed database tables. The main idea is to divide crucial database data and distribute it across different (public and private) cloud providers. Thus, every provider only gets a small part of the data. These individual small parts are worthless without the other parts and enable enterprises to meet their compliance rules concerning data security and protection. So Cloud Computing becomes an interesting alternative to store vast amounts of data. This work evaluates our approach from a performance point of view and presents the corresponding query times with and without vertically partitioned data.

AB  - When more and more nodes and users are connected in the Internet in the cases of Cloud computing, centralized computing modes will be failed with the limit band width and privacies. P2P technologies may be the future architecture of Cloud computing. This paper introduces a different P2P technology: semantic P2P Network -- Virtual Hierarchical Tree Gird Organizations (VIRGO), which can solve the Cloud computing's problems of transparency, scalability, and security. Other than unstructured and DHT-based structured P2P networks, the nodes of VIRGO are identified as domain names classified by the semantic meaning of roles in the organizations. VIRGO is easy to implement transparency as it have a simple global name schema. It also is scalable with log(N). Due to the data are stored in the users' own computers, VIRGO is easy to keep data privacies.

AB  - One of the most common security attack for web application is SQL injection. It is an attack to acquire access to application's database through injection of script or malicious query attributes. This attack can be executed in any page of web application which interacts with database. SQL injection could be more dangerous if the victim was an enterprise system such as online banking. Many methods have been researched and developed to prevent SQL injection attacks. One of them is the use of a honeypot. This paper proposed a method for increasing system's capability to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks based on removal of SQL query attribute values and honeypot for trapping attackers. A honeypot is placed as decoy system to hide actual web server from attacker. Malicious queries from attackers will be sent to honeypot while normal queries will be sent directly to the real web server. Honeypot is also used to provide activity logging of each attack which can be used for further analysis. We play with Raspberry Pi because it is cheap and effective to be used as a honeypot. Due to its limited computational ability, we make cluster to improve its power. Based on conducted experiments, we could achieve up to 64% accuracy of SQL injection attack. Moreover, with the redirection, our honeypot could get more attack data to be analyzed.

First, we identify a set requirements and design principles for the construction of new intrusion detection systems. Then, we present a set of grid capabilities and features which are fundamental for the implementation of new intrusion detection and response systems. As a contribution, we show how a grid-based collaborative environment can be employed in the production, delivery, and use of knowledge and mechanisms for intrusion detection and containment. Such environment provides a laboratory for the development of security resources (signatures, software patches, informative texts, logs, and others), augmented by a digital library capable of supporting the efficient storage, manipulation, and deployment of such resources. As the main result of this work, the efficiency and effectiveness of mechanisms and strategies can be enhanced.

AB  - The advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is a crucial component of the smart grid, replacing traditional analog devices with computerized smart meters. Smart meters have not only allowed for efficient management of many end-users, but also have made AMI an attractive target for remote exploits and local physical tampering with the end goal of stealing energy. While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior. Our experimental results on normal and anomalous load profiles show that AMIDS can identify energy theft efforts with high accuracy. Furthermore, AMIDS correctly identified legitimate load profile changes that more elementary analyses classified as malicious.

With all the preventive methods, malicious users still find new ways to overcome the system security and access and modify sensitive information. To make the process of damage assessment and recovery fast and effective (not scanning the entire log), researchers have proposed different methods for segmenting the log file, and accordingly presented different damage assessment and recovery algorithms. In this work we present efficient damage assessment and recovery algorithms to recover from malicious transactions in a database based on the concept of the matrix. We also compare the various approaches and present the performance results.

AB  - Pattern matching systems are mainly based on network models, which are formed from detailed analysis of user statistics and network traffic. These models are used in developing traffic analysis tools. This paper focuses on development of a behavior analysis tool on any operating system and its use on detecting internal active/passive attacks. Many kinds of tools and firewalls are in market to help network administrator to prevent intrusion from outside network, but very few tools to stop attacks from internal part of the network. This tool provides a way to detect any unusual behavior by a legitimate user in a network. It uses packet sniffer like Wireshark to record log traffic over a network. Furthermore, behavioral analysis is carried in two phases. In the first phase, Wireshark records the user's interaction with the network for a period of time and is stored in database. In second phase, current activity is compared to the past activity and notifies any new behavior to network administrator. This tool adds an additional layer of security along with the intrusion detection systems available from any network attacks. Many additional features can be incorporated in this tool for future enhancement.

AB  - Attacks against web servers and web-based applications remain a serious global network security threat. Attackers are able to compromise web services, collect confidential information from web data bases, interrupt or completely paralyze web servers. In this study, we consider the analysis of HTTP logs for the detection of network intrusions. First, a training set of HTTP requests which does not contain any attacks is analyzed. When all relevant information has been extracted from the logs, several clustering and anomaly detection algorithms are employed to describe the model of normal users behavior. This model is then used to detect network attacks as deviations from the norms in an online mode. The simulation results presented show that, compared to other data mining algorithms, the method results in a higher accuracy rate.

AB  - In recent years the attack vectors in the network world have increased many fold with the increased usage of Internet and with the exponential growth of various applications. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the most sought after system by security experts in safeguarding the network from both external and internal attacks. NIDS works mainly in two modes: Online and Offline. Online or real-time NIDS, such as Snort, Bro, etc., examines the packet structure to find intrusions, if any, and alerts the administrator. On the other hand, offline NIDS logs the packets flowing to and from the network, constructs features based on connections, and creates a dataset. Such NIDS datasets are used in research purposes for applying data mining, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc., to detect attacks. KDD CUP 99 is one such widely used popular IDS dataset. KDD CUP 99 dataset is obsolete because many of the attacks performed to create the dataset do not exist now. Moreover, the features constructed do not pertain to network activities. It is a mixture of host based as well as network based features. So, the need for a new dataset, conforming to the present network activities and attack vectors, is inevitable. This motivated us to come out with a NIDS dataset, SSENet-2011 dataset, in this paper. SSENet-2011 dataset was constructed using Tstat tool. A real time experiment was performed, the network packets were captured, features were constructed, and the dataset was created. The created SSENet-2011 dataset was compared with the KDD CUP 99 dataset. From the experiments it is evident that a closed and secluded network such as SSENet and Tstat tool help researchers in developing and analyzing a new dataset which reflects the changing scenario of network activities.

AB  - A fundamental problem in detecting threats to security by monitoring computer usage is the high number of false positives that are created when analyzing a large data set for anomalous behavior. We address the problem by modeling user behavior at multiple scales so as to allow for the identification potential insider threats from users' logged activity by tracking users' activity over time. In this work, we apply a novel method for representing user activity at multiple temporal scales to a dataset that contains malicious behavior. We report our detection results and discuss how a layered detection method may be advantageous for the discovery of specific types of malicious behavior.

AB  - Nowadays, almost every task involving Web traversing and information retrieval recurs to Web robots. Web robots are software programs that automatically traverse the Web's hypertext structure. They proliferate rapidly aside with the growth of the Web and are extremely valuable and important means not only for the large search engines, but also for many specialized services such as investment portals, competitive intelligence tools, etc. While many web robots serve useful purposes, recently, there have been cases linked to fraudulent activities committed by these Web robots. Click fraud, which is the act of generating illegitimate clicks, is one of them. This paper details the architecture and functionality of the Smart ClickBot, a sophisticated software bot that is designed to commit click fraud. It was first detected and reported by NetMosaics Inc. in March, 2010, a real time click fraud detection and prevention solution provider. We discuss the machine learning algorithms used, to identify all clicks exhibiting Smart ClickBot like patterns. We constructed a Bayesian classifier that automatically classifies server log data as being Smart ClickBot or not. We also introduce a Benchmark data set for Smart ClickBot. We disclose the results of our investigation of this bot to educate the security research community and provide information regarding the novelties of the attack.

AB  - Because of distributed nature, grid computing environments are easy targets for intruders looking for possible vulnerabilities to exploit [1]. By impersonating legitimate users, the intruders can use a service's abundant resources maliciously. To combat attackers, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) can offer additional security measures for these environments by investigating configurations, logs, network traffic, and user actions to identify typical attack behavior. However, IDS must be distributed to work in a grid computing environment. It must monitor each node and, when an attack occurs, alert other nodes in the environment. This kind of communication requires compatibility between heterogeneous hosts, various communication mechanisms, and permission control over system maintenance and updates. We present the problem of grid intrusion; analyze the requirements of a system to detect them. In this paper we are discussing how IDS can be implemented for grid computing environment.

AB  - Today some companies use Process Aware Information Systems to support their business processes. These Systems adopt processes to business environment quickly. Since system allows to users to change processes, system is vulnerable to fraud. Thus we need a balance between security and flexibility. The solution can be a fraud detection system, but the increasing growth of data in logs causes some difficulties. In this paper we proposed an approach that use map-reduce mechanism to implement a fraud detection method in a distributed way.

AB  - On demand allocation of honeypots at right places on the network and at right time would considerably make the network more secure and harder to sneak into. This paper proposes an idea of dynamically creating, modifying and managing virtual honeypots-Honeydoop. Honeydoop is a system of dynamically creating, modifying and managing virtual honeypots. It combines the concept of honeypots and uses big data analyzer Hadoop for quick information retrieval and analysis. The goal of the system is to create evanescent honeypots at right places and times, on demand, to achieve better security in this ever changing environment. The system finds the machines on the network which attackers are interested in using IDS alerts and network traffic analysis. Virtual honeypots replicating those systems are then created and deployed on the network. Suspicious traffic destined for the target system is then redirected to the newly created honeypot. Dormant honeypots are deleted periodically. Honeydoop can also be used to analyze existing honeypot logs.

AB  - Cloud computing is becoming a key driver in supporting all on-demand needs of corporate IT today. Cloud promises extensive mechanisms for apt resource sharing, maximum resource utilization, and true elasticity as compared to any of its early contestants. Even after recognizing its advantages, many organizations are reluctant to take up this next-generation computing, due to its severe security concerns. In today's world, whole business computing relies on the security of customers and their data. Due to its public and multi-tenancy nature, security concerns are very huge in capacity. eCloudIDS is a next-generation generic security framework architected with innovative hybrid two-tier expert engines, namely uX-Engine and sX-Engine, considered to be most suitable security solution for any cloud computing environments; precisely for public and hybrid clouds. This paper explores the architectural design facets of eCloudIDS security framework's iCloudIDM Subsystem Layer-II (iCloudIDM-LII) that extends the identity management capabilities at Cloud VM Level.

AB  - As software security has increasingly become an important part of information security programs, there have been some notable trends and successes of various tools, processes, and models. Because "building security in" is so different from how enterprise software has historically been developed, the changes might seem revolutionary. In the enterprise, revolutionary changes involve cost and complexity, as organizations figure out how to incorporate new techniques, processes, and technology. The paper shows an informal list that doesn't say, "simply reboot your entire enterprise software development and you are ready to begin secure coding." Instead, it describes how people with limited budgets and/or authority can make potentially big changes in their enterprise software's overall security. 10 low or no-cost ideas were discussed in this paper.

AB  - This paper proposed a security compliance model that presents security and access control features which are employed at the time of origin of Big Data. The growth rate of data dealing devices and generation of data has increased exponentially which led to the massive explosion of data availability both in structured or unstructured form also known as big data. The challenge is to analyze this unstructured form of data and categories in a momentous form.The tool design to process big data without considering the security and access control feature in mind that its security is not inbuilt in these systems. Moreover, because of the huge size data it becomes a very tedious task to incorporate security feature at a later stage. So the security should be embedded in the initial or design stage.

AB  - Software log file analysis helps immensely in software testing and troubleshooting. The first step in automated log file analysis is extracting log data. This requires decoding the log file syntax and interpreting data semantics. The expected output of this phase is an organization of the extracted data for further processing. Log data extractors can be developed using popular programming languages targeting one or few log file formats. Rather than repeating this process for each log file format, it is desirable to have a generic scheme for interpreting elements of a log file and filling a data structure suitable for further processing. The new log data extraction scheme introduced in this paper is an attempt to provide the advanced features demanded by modern log file analysis procedures. It is a generic scheme which is capable of handling both text and binary log files with complex structures and difficult syntax. Its output is a tree filled with the information of interest for the particular case.

AB  - No matter how robust the employed security mechanisms are malicious users or attackers will always find a way to bypass them. In addition, National Institute of Security and Technology mentions "In conjunction with appropriate tools &amp; procedures, audit trail can assist in detecting security violation and flaws in applications". Until now, in Multimedia Communication Services (MCS), such as Voice over IP, audit trails are not utilized in security audits due to (a) the lack of the appropriate analysis tools and (b) privacy restrictions. In this paper we report on the analysis of MCS audit trail by employing a novel method for identifying "uncommon" traffic indicating non normal behaviour that does not violate users' privacy. We rely on entropy theory and the notion of "itself information" to quantify the randomness of specific message segments, and we also introduce the term "actual itself information" for the assessment of entire message randomness. To protect users' privacy we hash audit trail's data. For evaluating the applicability of our proposed method we utilize an audit trail of a real MCS provider published by honey pot project. Initial outcomes show the feasibility of employing such a method to recognize "uncommon" traffic, recorded in MCS audit trail.

AB  - Value of software log file analysis has been constantly increasing with the value of information to organizations. Log management tools still have a lot to deliver in order to empower their customers with the true strength of log information. In addition to the traditional uses such as testing software functional conformance, troubleshooting and performance benchmarking, log analysis has proven its capabilities in fields like intrusion detection and compliance evaluation. This is verified by the emphasis on log analysis in regulations like PCI DSS, FISMA, HIPAA and frameworks such as ISO 27001 and COBIT. In this paper we present an in depth analysis into current log analysis domains and common problems. A practical guide to the use of few popular log analysis tools is also included. Lack of proper support for structured analysis is identified as one major flaw in existing tools. After that, we describe a framework we developed for structured log analysis with the view of providing a solution to open problems in the domain. The core strength of the framework is its ability to handle many log file formats that are not well served by existing tools and providing sophisticated infrastructure for automating recurring log analysis procedures. We prove the usefulness of the framework with a simple experiment.

Our results indicate that both systems effectively present significantly more information when compared to traditional textual approaches. We believe that the interactive, graphical techniques that we present will have broad applications in other domains seeking to deal with information overload.

Therefore, this demands the need for something more secure along with being more user-friendly. Therefore, we have tried to increase the security by involving a 3-level security approach, involving text based password at Level 1, Image Based Authentication at Level 2, and automated generated one-time password (received through an automated email to the authentic user) at Level 3. And an assiduous effort has been done for thwarting Shoulder attack, Tempest attack, and Brute-force attack at client side, through the use of unique image set in the IBA System.

AB  - In this paper we present a scheme for building a logging- trail for processes related to eGovernment services. A citizen can reconstruct the trail of such a process and verify its status if he is the subject of that process. Reconstruction is based on hand-overs, special types of log events, that link data stored by multiple logging servers, which are not necessarily trusted. Our scheme is privacy-friendly in the sense that only the authorised subject, i.e. the citizen, can link the different log entries related to one specific process. The scheme is also auditable; it allows logging servers to show that they behave according to a certain policy.

AB  - In this paper, a recovery scheme for safe execution of untrusted programs is presented. In this scheme, when the effects of untrusted program execution is undesirable, system can be easily rolled back to the initial state where the checkpoint is set before the program executed. In high level security systems, only the trustworthy programs, whose names are listed in a whitelist, are allowed to execute. However forbidding all the anonymous programs is unacceptable. In order to reduce the risk of running the uncertified program, many solutions has been proposed to solve the problem, most of which can be categorized into three kinds: detection, protection or recovery. As a recovery scheme, the system doesn't change the program and its context at runtime, and just monitors the process of its execution, records the access it made to system resources, and simultaneously backs up the modification it made to file system. When the record shows the effect of the program is unexpected, the administrator can undo what the program has modified to the file system according to the record. We have implemented a prototype system for Linux operating system using Linux Security Modules (LSM), which can be integrated into other security modules seamlessly. Key advantages of our scheme are that it requires no changes to the untrusted programs or its execution context; it doesn't do anything to hinder the execution process, and only has negligible performance overhead.

AB  - Detection of execution anomalies is very important for the maintenance, development, and performance refinement of large scale distributed systems. Execution anomalies include both work flow errors and low performance problems. People often use system logs produced by distributed systems for troubleshooting and problem diagnosis. However, manually inspecting system logs to detect anomalies is unfeasible due to the increasing scale and complexity of distributed systems. Therefore, there is a great demand for automatic anomalies detection techniques based on log analysis. In this paper, we propose an unstructured log analysis technique for anomalies detection. In the technique, we propose a novel algorithm to convert free form text messages in log files to log keys without heavily relying on application specific knowledge. The log keys correspond to the log-print statements in the source code which can provide cues of system execution behavior. After converting log messages to log keys, we learn a Finite State Automaton (FSA) from training log sequences to present the normal work flow for each system component. At the same time, a performance measurement model is learned to characterize the normal execution performance based on the log messages' timing information. With these learned models, we can automatically detect anomalies in newly input log files. Experiments on Hadoop and SILK show that the technique can effectively detect running anomalies.

AB  - Log data adapted for intrusion detection is a little explored research issue despite its importance for successful and efficient detection of attacks and intrusions. This paper presents a starting point in the search for suitable log data by providing a framework for determining exactly which log data that can reveal a specific attack, i.e. the attack manifestations. An attack manifestation consists of the log entries added, changed or removed by the attack compared to normal behaviour. We demonstrate the use of the framework by studying attacks in different types of log data. This work provides a foundation for a fully automated attack analysis. It also provides some pointers for how to define a collection of log elements that are both sufficient and necessary for detection of a specific group of attacks. We believe that this lead to a log data source that is especially adapted for intrusion detection purposes.

AB  - eGovernment deploys governmental information and services for citizens and general society. As the Internet is being used as underlying platform for information exchange, these services are exposed to data tampering and unauthorised access as main threats against citizen privacy. These issues have been usually tackled by applying controls at application level, making authentication stronger and protecting credentials in transit using digital certificates. However, these efforts to enhance security on governmental web sites have been only focused on what malicious users can do from the outside, and not in what insiders can do to alter data straight on the databases. In fact, the lack of security controls at back-end level hinders every effort to find evidence and investigate events related to credential misuse and data tampering. Moreover, even though attackers can be found and prosecuted, there is no evidence and audit trails on the databases to link illegal activities with identities. In this article, a Salting-Based Authentication Module and a Database Intrusion Detection Module are proposed as enhancements to eGovernment security to provide better authentication and auditing controls.

In this paper we propose a model for securing the system along with the network and enhance it more by applying machine learning techniques SVM (support vector machine) and ANN (Artificial Neural Network). Both the techniques are used together to generate results which are appropriate for analysis purpose and thus, prove to be the milestone for security.

AB  - Region duplication is a common type of digital image tampering. This paper presents a log-polar based approach to detect such forgery even if the copied area has been rotated and/or scaled. We compute log-polar fast Fourier transform (LPFFT) on image blocks to approximate the log-polar Fourier transform (LPFT). LPFFT is based on a nearly log-polar system where conversion to log-polar coordinates only involves 1-D Fourier transform and interpolation operations. In addition to rotation and scaling invariance, computation complexity of LPFFT is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>log<i>n</i>) , much lower than <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>4</sup>) of LPFT when <i>n</i> is large. Similarity of the LPFFT results between different blocks provides indication of image tampering. Experimental results show efficacy of the proposed method.

AB  - Databases that contain critical information become prime targets for attacks. E-Government sites often contain data that must remain available to its users with as little interruption as possible. In case an intrusion into such a system is detected, quick damage assessment and recovery of data is vital for maintaining system functionality. Conventional log based damage assessment methods require that the log of an affected database must be scanned from the occurrence of the attacking transaction to the end of the log. Hence, these methods result in slow recovery time since they have to unnecessarily process large volume of data, a lot of which may be unaffected by the attack. In this paper, we have provided a model that can expedite the damage assessment and recovery process by using minimal log access. Our approach uses multiple agents to perform damage assessment and recovery processes in parallel and, as a result, minimizes system down time.

AB  - This paper presents the intrusion detection toolkit (IDtk), an information visualization tool for intrusion detection (ID). IDtk was developed through a user-centered design process, in which we identified design guidelines to support ID users. ID analysts protect their networks by searching for evidence of attacks in ID system output, firewall and system logs, and other complex, textual data sources. Monitoring and analyzing these sources incurs a heavy cognitive load for analysts. The use of information visualization techniques offers a valuable addition to the toolkit of the ID analyst. Several visualization techniques for ID have been developed, but few usability or field studies have been completed to assess the needs of ID analysts and the usability and usefulness of these tools. We intended to fill this gap by applying a user-centered design process in the development and evaluation of IDtk, a 3D, glyph-based visualization tool that gives the user maximum flexibility in setting up how the visualization display represents ID data. The user can also customize whether the display is a simple, high-level overview to support monitoring, or a more complex 3D view allowing for viewing the data from multiple angles and thus supporting analysis and diagnosis. This flexibility was found crucial in our usability evaluation. In addition to describing the tool, we report the findings of our user evaluation and propose new guidelines for the design of information visualization tools for ID.

AB  - System log files are critical for troubleshooting complex modern computer systems. Systems can easily produce more log file entries than a human can realistically use. However, there are a number of good filtering and clustering technologies that are used in various areas of data mining. This research focuses on using very easily accessible Bayesian spam filters for categorizing log entries. Results of this research have confirmed that these filters can be effectively used to discover log entries related to known issues, and to effectively disprove outage relationships. Both of these techniques can be easily instrumented in a log analysis framework and provide administrators with much needed filtering for similar logs and thus, similar outages.

AB  - For complex services, logging is an integral part of many middleware aspects, especially, transactions and monitoring. In the event of a failure, the log allows us to deduce the cause of failure (diagnosis), recover by compensating the logged actions (atomicity), etc. However, for heterogeneous services, logging all the actions is often impracticable due to privacy/security constraints. Also, logging is expensive in terms of both time and space. Thus, we are interested in determining a small number of actions that needs to be logged, to know with certainty the actual sequence of executed actions from any given partial log. We propose two heuristics to determine such a small set of transitions, with services modeled as finite state machines. The first one is based on (Positive) discrimination of transitions, using every observation to know (discriminate) that a maximal number of transitions occurred. We characterize it algebraically, giving a very fast algorithm. The second algorithm, the distinguishing algorithm, uses every observation to maximize the number of transitions which are ensured not to have occurred. We show experimentally that the second algorithm gives much more accurate results than the first one, although it is also slower (but still fast enough).

It uses binary XML technology to organize the data. The structure of the event log file is complex and the information is not directviewing. This paper propose a solution that we adopt XML technology to parse Vista event log file and to present the result intuitively. The result can be applied into further computer forensics.

AB  - Large software systems often keep log files of events. Such log files can be analyzed to check whether a run of a program reveals faults in the system. We discuss how such log files can be used in software testing. We present a framework for automatically analyzing log files, and describe a language for specifying analyzer programs and an implementation of that language. The language permits compositional, compact specifications of software, which act as test oracles; we discuss the use and efficacy of these oracles for unit- and system-level testing in various settings. We explore methodological issues such as efficiency and logging policies, and the scope and limitations of the framework. We conclude that testing using log file analysis constitutes a useful methodology for software verification, somewhere between current testing practice and formal verification methodologies

AB  - In anomaly detection, one important issue how to model the normal behavior of activities performed by a user is an important issue. To extract the normal behavior from the activities of a user, conventional data mining techniques are widely applied to a finite audit data set. However, these approaches can only model the static behavior of a user in the audit data set. This drawback can be overcome by viewing the continuous activities of a user as an audit data stream. This paper proposes an anomaly detection method that continuously models the normal behavior of a user over the multi-dimensional audit data stream. Each cluster represents the frequent range of the activities with respect to a set of features. As a result, without physically maintaining any historical activity of a user, the new activities of the user can be continuously reflected onto the on-going result. At the same time, various statistics of the activities related to the identified clusters are additionally modeled to improve the performance of anomaly detection. The proposed algorithm is analyzed by a series of experiments to identify various characteristics.

AB  - Honeypot is a prominent technology that helps us learn new hacking techniques from attackers and intruders. The much information from multiple Honeypot servers, the more appropriate signatures we can generate. To ease the administrator to manage and monitor trace files from multiple Honeypot servers that are distributed in various locations at the same time, in this paper we design and implement a prototype of log management server to automatically and periodically collect log files from them. Information reported by each Honeypot server will be sent in secure manner to the log management server. The log management server then parses the information into the database server, where users can search for specific information through the web interface, such as searching based on one or two Honeypot servers. Moreover, the geographical distribution of attackers is visualized in the world map by utilizing the WHOIS database and GeoPlot software.

AB  - With the popularity of various software applications in cloud computing, software exception becomes an important issue. How to detect the exceptions more quickly seems to be crucial for the software service company. To solve the above problem, this paper presents an efficient log anomaly detection method named PADM (Page Rank-based Anomaly Detection Method) based on the graph computing algorithm. In this method, the logs are transformed into a graph to represent the complex relationship between the log records, then we design an extended Page Rank algorithm based on the graph to get the importance score for each log. After that, we compare the scores to that of the training logs to determine whether they are abnormal or not. Finally, we compare PADM with other anomaly detection methods on the real logs, and the results show that it outperforms the currently widely used mechanisms with higher accuracy, lower time complexity and better scalability.

AB  - With the development of Internet, the audit work of IDS (intrusion detection system) is becoming harder. The way of examining log file in text format cannot adapt to the serious situation. In this paper, the NLP (natural language process) technology is introduced to resolve this problem, which can provide a way to interact with audit log file database easily. The FUG (function unification grammar) in NLP is applied to intelligent query in IDS audit system, and XML (extension markup language) schema is utilized in expression of accidence, syntax, glossary library and grammar. At the same time, the feature structure is used to describe the structure of vocabulary, phrase and sentence. These measures can make the query system more intelligent, extendable and friendly.

AB  - Much recent work has focused on the process of auditing the results of elections. Little work has focused on auditing the e-voting systems currently in use. The facilities for doing the former include the voter-verified paper audit trail; unfortunately, that VVPAT is not particularly helpful in tracking down the source of errors within e-voting systems. This paper discusses the need for a detailed forensic audit trail (FAT) to enable auditors to analyze the actions of e-voting systems, in order to demonstrate either the absence of problems or to find the causes of problems. We also discuss methods to prevent the use of the FAT as a covert channel for violating the necessary properties of secrecy of the ballot, so voters cannot sell their votes, and anonymity of the ballot, so a third party cannot associate a particular ballot with the voter who cast it.

AB  - Mariner is an iSCSI-based storage system that is designed to provide comprehensive data protection on commodity ATA disk and gigabit Ethernet technologies while offering the same performance as those without any such protection. In particular, Mariner supports continuous data protection (CDP) that allows every disk update within a time window to be undoable, and local/remote mirroring to guard data against machine/site failures. To minimize the performance overhead associated with CDP, Mariner employs a modified track-based logging technique that unifies the long-term logging required for CDP and short-term logging for low-latency disk writes. This new logging technique strikes an optimal balance among log space utilization, disk write latency, and ease of historical data access. To reduce the performance penalty of physical data replication used in local/remote mirroring, Mariner features a modified two-phase commit protocol that in turn is built on top of a novel transparent reliable multicast (TRM) mechanism specifically designed for Ethernet-based storage area networks. Without flooding the network, TRM is able to keep the network traffic load of reliable N-way replication roughly at the same level as the no-replication case, regardless of the value of N. Empirical performance measurements on the first Mariner prototype, which is built from gigabit Ethernet and ATA disks, shows that the average end-to-end latency for a 4KByte iSCSI write is under 1.2 msec when data logging and replication are both turned on.

It monitors either the video provided is fully or atleast partly viewed thus accordingly their ratings given. It also checks whether the login in network which is providing rating is either from same location or its location varies each and every time from vast geographical location. It also checks whether from same ip address multiple logins giving ratings continuously. Thus by doing this the attacker is also detected and given counter measure to their attacks.

The method, named NIGELOG, produces multiple backups of the logging information, hides them in arbitrary directories, and periodically moves these backups to other directories. Also, NIGELOG can automatically restore the original logging information by using the backups even if the original file is altered or deleted by intruders. NIGELOG is implemented as a C++ class library with some standard software libraries and does not require additional hardware such as write-once media. It is easier to apply NIGELOG to UNIX applications which produces log-files

AB  - An oracle is a mechanism commonly used for determining whether a system has passed or failed a test, which is very important for software testing. A log file, used to record the history of software's behavior, provides a means for debugging and testing. Log file analysis (LFA) is a lately applied approach for test oracle, having shown its applicable prospect in software testing. To achieve the better feature of general purpose, we propose a practical test oracle framework based on log file analysis, presents a 7-tuple state machine model for the analyzer and designs a description language to describe the state machine. The data structures and the algorithm for the implementation of this method are also given. Experimental results show this method can be easily used to test software whether on system-testing level or unit-testing level, suitable for various software testing.

AB  - Malicious users can exploit the correlation among data to infer sensitive information from a series of seemingly innocuous data accesses. Thus, we develop an inference violation detection system to protect sensitive data content. Based on data dependency, database schema and semantic knowledge, we constructed a semantic inference model (SIM) that represents the possible inference channels from any attribute to the pre-assigned sensitive attributes. The SIM is then instantiated to a semantic inference graph (SIG) for query-time inference violation detection. For a single user case, when a user poses a query, the detection system will examine his/her past query log and calculate the probability of inferring sensitive information. The query request will be denied if the inference probability exceeds the prespecified threshold. For multi-user cases, the users may share their query answers to increase the inference probability. Therefore, we develop a model to evaluate collaborative inference based on the query sequences of collaborators and their task-sensitive collaboration levels. Experimental studies reveal that information authoritativeness, communication fidelity and honesty in collaboration are three key factors that affect the level of achievable collaboration. An example is given to illustrate the use of the proposed technique to prevent multiple collaborative users from deriving sensitive information via inference.

AB  - We describe and apply a lightweight formal method for checking test results. The method assumes that the software under test writes a text log file; this log file is then analyzed by a program to see if it reveals failures. We suggest a state-machine-based formalism for specifying the log file analyzer programs and describe a language and implementation based on that formalism. We report on empirical studies of the application of log file analysis to random testing of units. We describe the results of experiments done to compare the performance and effectiveness of random unit testing with coverage checking and log file analysis to other unit testing procedures. The experiments suggest that writing a formal log file analyzer and using random testing is competitive with other formal and informal methods for unit testing.

AB  - Analyzing the run time behavior of large software systems is a difficult and challenging task. Log analysis has been proposed as a possible solution. However, such an analysis poses unique challenges, mostly due to the volume and diversity of the logged data that is collected, thus making this analysis often intractable for practical purposes. In this paper, we present a log analysis technique that aims to compute a smaller, compared to the original, collection of events that relate to a given analysis objective. The technique is based on computing a similarity score between the logged events and a collection of significant events that we refer to as beacons. The major novelties of the proposed technique are that it is domain independent and that it does not require the use of a pre-existing training data set. The technique has been evaluated against the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation 1999 and the KDD 1999 data sets with promising results.

AB  - In a distributed database system, damage assessment after an information attack is a complicated task due to intricate transaction relationships among distributed sites. In these systems, when any sub-transaction reads a damaged data at any site the entire transaction of which the sub-transaction is a part is considered affected by the damage. Hence, the data items updated by that transaction irrespective of sites are also considered damaged. To control spread of damage, accurate damage assessment and appropriate recovery procedures must be performed as soon as an attack is detected. This research focuses on damage assessment procedures for distributed database systems and uses pre-developed data structures for fast and accurate result. The method presented in this paper quickly identifies all affected transactions and all damaged data items without any log access.

AB  - System- and application-level failures could be characterized by analyzing relevant log files. The resulting data might then be used in numerous studies on and future developments for the mission-critical and large scale computational architecture, including fields such as failure prediction, reliability modeling, performance modeling and power awareness. In this paper, system logs covering a six month period of the Blue Gene/L supercomputer were obtained and subsequently analyzed. Temporal filtering was applied to remove duplicated log messages. Optimistic and pessimistic perspectives were exerted on filtered log information to observe failure behavior within the system. Further, various time to repair factors were applied to obtain application time to interrupt, which will be exploited in further resilience modeling research.

AB  - Data mining is the process of finding correlations in the relational databases. There are different techniques for identifying malicious database transactions. Many existing approaches which profile is SQL query structures and database user activities to detect intrusion, the log mining approach is the automatic discovery for identifying anomalous database transactions. Mining of the Data is very helpful to end users for extracting useful business information from large database. Multi-level and multi-dimensional data mining are employed to discover data item dependency rules, data sequence rules, domain dependency rules, and domain sequence rules from the database log containing legitimate transactions. Database transactions that do not comply with the rules are identified as malicious transactions. The log mining approach can achieve desired true and false positive rates when the confidence and support are set up appropriately. The implemented system incrementally maintain the data dependency rule sets and optimize the performance of the intrusion detection process.

AB  - Cloud is a virtual image about some amount of undefined powers, that is widespread and had unknown power and inexact amount of hardware and software configurations, and because of we have not any information about clouds location and time dimensions and also the amounts of its sources we tell that Cloud Computing. This technology presents lots of abilities and opportunities such as processing power, storage and accessing it from everywhere, supporting, working - team group - with the latest versions of software and etc., by the means of internet. On the other hand, in such a large scale networks we should consider the reliability and powerfulness of such networks in facing with events such as high amount of users that may login to their profiles simultaneously, or for example if we have the ability to predict about what times that we would have the most crowd in network, or even users prefer to use which part of the Cloud Computing more than other parts - which software or hardware configuration. With knowing such information, we can avoid accidental crashing or hanging of the network that may be cause by logging of too much users. In this paper we propose Kalman Filter that can be used for estimating the amounts of users and software's that run on cloud computing or other similar platforms at a certain time. After introducing this filter, at the end of paper, we talk about some potentials of this filter in cloud computing platform. In this paper we demonstrate about how we can use Kalman filter in estimating and predicting of our target, by the means of several examples on Kalman filter.

AB  - Distributed denial-of-service attacks have become the major threat to Internet today. IP traceback is one of the most effective techniques to defeat these attacks by identifying attack sources even in the presence of IP spoofing. Because of low marking packet utilization, the convergence time of traditional probabilistic packet marking (PPM) schemes is still too long. In order to shorten the convergence time, a distributed-log-based IP traceback scheme is proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that this scheme not only can converge more quickly than previous PPM schemes, but also has much less log overhead than other log-based schemes

AB  - Network traffic is increasing all the time and network services are becoming more complex and vulnerable. To protect these networks, intrusion detection systems are used. Signature-based intrusion detection cannot find previously unknown attacks, which is why anomaly detection is needed. However, many new systems are slow and complicated. We propose a log anomaly detection framework which aims to facilitate quick anomaly detection and also provide visualizations of the network traffic structure. The system preprocesses network logs into a numerical data matrix, reduces the dimensionality of this matrix using random projection and uses Mahalanobis distance to find outliers and calculate an anomaly score for each data point. Log lines that are too different are flagged as anomalies. The system is tested with real-world network data, and actual intrusion attempts are found. In addition, visualizations are created to represent the structure of the network data. We also perform computational time evaluation to ensure the performance is feasible. The system is fast, finds intrusion attempts and does not need clean training data.

AB  - In this paper, we present a framework for an open source BlackBerry Inter@ctive Pager Backup/Restore (IPD) file forensics tool. Our reasoning for developing an open source version of an IPD parser is to enhance the available open source forensic tools; an example of this category of tools is the Sleuth Kit. One intention of this work is to make users of BlackBerrys aware of the vulnerability of their information on their computers. Commercial tools such as the ABC Amber BlackBerry Converter application [6] presently exist. That commercial tool is able to gather the messages, contacts, SMS records, memos, call logs, and the task list from an IPD file. It then exports these records in a variety of forms. Another commercial tool by Paraben [4] can export data into closed source forensic tool kits such as Encase and FTK [5]. While still a work in progress, the preliminary results indicate that the method developed for extracting information is valid. The end goal of this research is to produce a model that can be adopted by open source forensic practitioners in their examinations and toolkit development.

Analyzed here is an incremental design of unified auditing and monitoring platform (UAM) in view point of business software. In fact, UAM is an integrated managing system of logs and running parameters. Database is the core of all kinds of management information system (MIS), and the more business logic implemented in database, the less coding work left to programmers. In this paper, complex network is introduced into the database table designing to visualization the internal associations which denotes the external business logic relationship. Though an example is discussed, but the approach can be widely used in various MIS system design, especially in large scale information system.

AB  - Secure logs are powerful tools for building systems that must resist forgery, prove temporal relationships, and stand up to forensic scrutiny. The proofs of order and integrity encoded in these tamper-evident chronological records, typically built using hash chaining, may be used by applications to enforce operating constraints or sound alarms at suspicious activity. However, existing research stops short of discussing how one might go about automatically determining whether a given secure log satisfies a given set of constraints on its records. In this paper, we discuss our work on Querifier, a tool that accomplishes this. It can be used offline as an analyzer for static logs, or online during the runtime of a logging application. Querifier rules are written in a flexible pattern-matching language that adapts to arbitrary log structures; given a set of rules and available log data, Querifier presents evidence of correctness and offers counterexamples if desired. We describe Querfier's implementation and offer early performance results.

AB  - Ad hoc networks operate mostly over open environments and are hence vulnerable to a large number of threats. This calls for providing advanced intrusion detection. To meet this requirement, we introduce IDAR, a signature- and log-based distributed intrusion detector dedicated to ad hoc routing protocols. Contrary to existing systems that observe packets, IDAR analyses the logs generated by the OLSR protocol and identifies patterns of misuse. This detector copes with the resource-constraints of devices by providing distributed detection. In particular, depending on the level of suspicion/gravity involved, in-depth cooperative investigation is launched. Simulation shows limited bandwidth usage, high detection and low false positives.

AB  - The domain name service (DNS) provides a critical function in directing Internet traffic. Defending DNS servers from bandwidth attacks is assisted by the ability to effectively mine DNS log data for statistical patterns. Processing DNS log data can be classified as a data-intensive problem, and as such presents challenges unique to this class of problem. When problems occur in capturing log data, or when the DNS server experiences an outage (scheduled or unscheduled), the normal pattern of traffic for that server becomes clouded. Simple linear interpolation of the holes in the data does not preserve features such as peaks in traffic (which can occur during an attack, making them of particular interest). We demonstrate a method for estimating values for missing portions of time sensitive DNS log data. This method would be suitable for use with a variety of datasets containing time series values where certain portions are missing.

Through introducing basic concepts of web log mining and private data protection, this paper analyzes the status quo of privacy preservation in web log mining, and then it puts forward privacy preserving mining model based on evolutionary algorithm of cloud model, combining with evolutionary algorithm and cloud model theory. This model utilizes digital features of cloud and transformation between its qualitative concept and quantitative value expression. Thus, this model effectively conceals sensitive data, realizes web log mining based on privacy preservation. Results of the experiment reveal the feasibility and superiority of applying evolutionary algorithm of cloud model to privacy preservation in web log mining.

AB  - With advancement in science and technology, computing systems become increasingly more difficult to monitor, manage and maintain. Traditional approaches to system management have been largely based on domain experts through a knowledge acquisition process to translate domain knowledge into operating rules and policies. This has been experienced as a cumbersome, labor intensive, and error prone process. There is thus a pressing need for automatic and efficient approaches to monitor and manage complex computing systems. A popular approach to system management is based on analyzing system log files. However, several new aspects of the system log data have been less emphasized in existing analysis methods and posed several challenges. The aspects include disparate formats and relatively short text messages in data reporting, asynchronous data collection, and temporal characteristics in data representation. First, a typical computing system contains different devices with different software components, possibly from different providers. These various components have multiple ways to report events, conditions, errors and alerts. The heterogeneity and inconsistency of log formats make it difficult to automate problem determination. To perform automated analysis, we need to categorize the text messages with disparate formats into common situations. Second, text messages in the log files are relatively short with a large vocabulary size. Third, each text message usually contains a timestamp. The temporal characteristics provide additional context information of the messages and can be used to facilitate data analysis. In this paper, we apply text mining to automatically categorize the messages into a set of common categories, and propose two approaches of incorporating temporal information to improve the categorization performance

AB  - Logs are the files which contain the information about all the events occurring on the system. Logs have been playing a vital role in providing all kinds of information which can be used for several purposes like detecting a suspicious behaviour over the system. The aim of this paper is to study, analyse and generate results by observing host. Log files consist of different header information which can be further used to determine if any kind of malicious activity is discovered then that activity can be traced and blocked.

AB  - In recent years, information leakage cases happen frequently and are one of big problems. 70% of such a cases are caused by human factors such as mismanagements and/or careless operations. Such a factors can be removed by the control of information flow and/or the check of computer operations. Therefore, some studies to control information flows have been proposed. However, almost studies focus on single computer. Thus, it is insufficient in recent working situations which exchange a lot of information through network. In this paper, we propose a framework to track sensitive information flow on multiple computers at kernel. The framework hooks system calls which may cause the diffusion of information, maintains their logs, and uses their logs to trace information. As the result, we can trace information on multiple computers. It would be useful for the control of the operations which uses sensitive information.

AB  - Understanding and troubleshooting wide area networks (such as military backbone networks and ISP networks) are challenging tasks due to their large, distributed, and highly dynamic nature. Building a system that can record and replay fine-grained behaviors of such networks would simplify this problem by allowing operators to recreate the sequence and precise ordering of events (e.g., packet-level forwarding decisions, route changes, failures) taking place in their networks. However, doing this at large scales seems intractable due to the vast amount of information that would need to be logged. In this paper, we propose a scalable and reliable framework to monitor fine-grained data-plane behavior within a large network. We give a feasible architecture for a distributed logging facility, a tree-based data structure for log compression and show how this logged information helps network operators to detect and debug anomalous behavior of the network. Experimental results obtained through trace-driven simulations and Click software router experiments show that our design is lightweight in terms of processing time, memory requirement and control overhead, yet still achieves over 99% precision in capturing network events.

Finally a novel hybrid solution is proposed that is based on the junction of log files with operational data and page tagging, which allows even exacter measurements of customer behavior. It allows a customization of the Analysis Tool and survives the shift of the technologies.

AB  - Currently, defense of the cyber space is mostly based on detection and/or blocking of attacks (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System - IDPS). But, a significant improvement for IDPS is the employment of forecasting techniques in a Distributed Intrusion Forecasting System (DIFS), which enables the capability for predicting attacks. Notwithstanding, during our earlier works, one of the issues we have faced was the huge amount of alerts produced by IDPS, several of them were false positives. Checking the veracity of alerts through other sources (multi-correlation), e.g. logs taken from the operating system (OS), is a way of reducing the number of false alerts, and, therefore, improving data (historical series) to be used by the DIFS. The goal of this paper is to propose a two stage system which allows: (1) employment of an Event Analysis System (EAS) for making multi-correlation between alerts from an IDPS with the OS' logs; and (2) applying forecasting techniques on data generated by the EAS. Tests applied on laboratory by the use of the two stage system allow concluding about the improvement of the historical series reliability, and the consequent improvement of the forecasts accuracy.

AB  - While the use of intrusion detection system (IDS), which monitors passively specific computing resources, and reports anomalous or intrusive activities, is becoming ubiquitous in today's network, evaluating IDS performance has been found to be challenging. Most IDS testing approaches are faced with selections with regard to their use of background traffic, which plays an important role in IDS testing. This paper presents the design and implementation of NBTRL, a software platform for network background traffic replay based on log files applied to IDS testing. NBTRL consists of information extraction module, packet preprocessing module and replay module. This software platform can extract traffic information from log files, control the speed of background traffic replay, process truncated packets, modify MAC address or IP address of packets, and provide a flexible and reusable experimental environment for IDS testing.

AB  - System anomaly detection is very important for development, maintenance and performance refinement in large scale distributed systems. It's a good way to obtain the troubleshooting and problem diagnosis by analyzing system logs produced by distributed systems. However, due to the increasing scale and complexity of distributed systems, the size of logs must be very large. Thus, it's inefficient for common methods to analyze system logs on single node. Therefore, there is a great demand to adopt a distributed method for anomaly detection techniques based on log analysis. In this paper, a MapReduce-Based Framework is implemented to analyze the distributed log for detecting anomaly. The framework is built on top of Hadoop, an open source distributed file system and MapReduce implementation. We first make use of Random Access File to realize an incremental way for aggregating system logs from each node of the monitored cluster, and collect them to the analysis cluster. Then, we apply the K-means clustering algorithm to integrate the collected logs. After that, we implement a MapReduce-Based algorithm to parser these clustered log files. Furthermore, in order to make the best use of this collected data, a flexible and powerful way is utilized to display monitoring and analysis results. Thus, we can monitor system status of large distributed cluster and detect its anomalies.

AB  - IP traceback is one of the most effective techniques to defeat the denial-of-service attacks and distributed denial-of-service attacks. And based on previous research, available probabilistic packet marking (PPM) schemes have more advantages than other IP traceback techniques. But the traditional schemes have too low marking packets utilization. In this paper, a new distributed-log-based scheme (DLS), which combines PPM and logging techniques, is proposed to utilize marking packets sufficiently. And, theoretical analysis and simulation results have proven that this scheme can converge more quickly than others. Based on this scheme the origin of an attack path can be traced by only several packets. Moreover, a MAC-enhanced hierarchical IP traceback system (HITS) is proposed to supply a gap of end-host schemes. We believe that MAC-enhanced HITS can be deployed and managed more conveniently and securely than end-host schemes. And the traceback results educed by it are more credible and authoritative.

AB  - A lot of effort has been taken to hide the content of a message from eavesdroppers. However, often not only the content, but also the address and identity of sender and/or receiver of the message are of interest for attackers. For that reason, several approaches were developed to guarantee anonymity in the case of email. A lot of services offer users to access Web pages unrecognised or without the risk of being backtracked, respectively. This kind of anonymity is called user or &ldquo;client anonymity&rdquo;. However, there are only a few offers that provide an equivalent protection for content providers, although this feature is desirable for many situations in which the identity of a publisher or content provider is to be hidden. This property is called server anonymity. The term &ldquo;server anonymity&rdquo; is explained in detail with the help of an existing system fulfilling some hundreds of thousand user requests per day. We also describe our experiences in providing such a system with respect to misuse. Furthermore there is another sensitive fact. While browsing Web pages, the used URLs are logged both by the Web client (Web browser) which is used and the Internet service provider (ISP), or any other instance or organisation that is involved in the communication. Hence the ISP can investigate the content a user is interested in afterwards simply by reusing the logged URLs. The same problem results from the behaviour of regular Web browsers to build an address history and local copies (browser cache) of the visited Web pages. We demonstrate a way of preventing the reuse of logged Web addresses by introducing the concept of temporarily valid Web addresses

AB  - Recently, the personal identities by the fingerprint authentication have been increasing everywhere, for example, in the automatic logging into a PC, the access control and the diligence &amp; indolence management in an office, and so on. In the fingerprint authentication, the fingerprint does not have to be remembered and there is no worry to be lost like a password, if once the information is registered with a server. The fingerprint, however, cannot be changed like a password if the information leaks out from the server. Therefore, the data processing is necessary not to be able to be decoded by another person. In this study, we use the fractional Fourier transform (FRT) as the method of data processing and analyze the fundamental properties of the decoded image in comparison with the original image.

AB  - Most e-commerce applications are implemented without any significant means of built-in performance measuring mechanisms, although responsiveness is a major factor for high revenue. Often, overall response times increase without the administrators even noticing. It is therefore crucial to have a precise measuring system that also reports customer behavioral patterns. We created a customizable e-commerce log file analyzer that measures performance mainly through combining a mix of log file data with e-shop information. It is capable of supporting multiple e-shops and can perform cross comparisons between them. It is easy to use and the software is extendable in order to support different web server architectures. It displays patterns taken by the user interaction with the e-shop and allows the administrators to locate less visited pages and make improvements or promote them better. This way an e-shop may benefit since it may lead to higher user satisfaction and profitability. The administrator can regularly study the readings and take the appropriate actions, if overall performance decay is observed.

AB  - An intrusion logger is a video surveillance application designed to detect intrusion events and document them by storing times-tamped images in a log. Face loggers, in particular, are focused in grabbing imagery of intruders face, and are typically used to provide inputs to a face recognition system. Commonly, intrusion loggers are supposed to signal an alarm condition as the intrusion occurs, and are therefore required to run in real time and to work continuously for long time periods. In this paper we present a face logging solution capable of detecting and tracking several targets in real time, grabbing face images and evaluating their quality in order to store only the best for each detected target. An evaluation of the performance on a specifically designed test set is provided.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to automated audits based on the pruning of log data represented as trees. Events, recorded as a sequential list of entries, are interpreted as nodes of a tree. The audit consists in removing the nodes that are compliant with the policy, so that the remaining tree consists only of the violations of the policy. Besides presenting the method, this paper demonstrates that the resultant method is more efficient than usual audit approaches by analyzing its theoretical complexity and the runtime figures obtained by a proof of concept.

AB  - Log files are commonly inspected by system administrators and developers to detect suspicious behaviors and diagnose failure causes. Since size of log files grows fast, thus making manual analysis impractical, different automatic techniques have been proposed to analyze log files. Unfortunately, accuracy and effectiveness of these techniques are often limited by the unstructured nature of logged messages and the variety of data that can be logged.This paper presents a technique to automatically analyze log files and retrieve important information to identify failure causes. The technique automatically identifies dependencies between events and values in logs corresponding to legal executions, generates models of legal behaviors and compares log files collected during failing executions with the generated models to detect anomalous event sequences that are presented to users. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the technique in supporting developers and testers to identify failure causes.

To achieve this goal the surface has to be built and this new environment has offer options with which non-library educated users would navigate effectively. Reaching this state the activities of present day online library users and library systems should be thoroughly analyzed. The sources of the analyses are the library log files. Well-designed log files would reveal, on one hand, the patterns of the users' activities which are crucial in building algorithms for the mental representation of searches. On the other hand, the analyses of these log files would shed light on the operation of the system.

AB  - Due to the abundantly available imaging technologies, manipulation of digital images has become a serious problem nowadays, in various fields like medical imaging, digital forensics, journalism, scientific publications, etc. In this paper, we concentrate on detection of a specific category of digital image forgery known as region duplication forgery or copy-move forgery, which is done by copying a block of an image and pasting it on to some other block of the same image. We present a novel approach based on the application of wavelet transform that detects and localizes such forgeries. Our technique works by first applying wavelet transform to the input image to yield a reduced dimension representation. We then perform exhaustive search to identify the similar blocks in the image by mapping them to log-polar coordinates and using phase correlation as the similarity criterion. This is done only once at the lowest resolution of the wavelet transform. Only the matched blocks are carried for comparison to the next level. This drastically reduces the time needed for the detection process. This approach works even if the pasted region has undergone transformations like translation and rotation.

AB  - Generally to secure a network from denial-of-service to Smurf attacks, hackers that perpetrate exploits, it is necessary to perform the tasks like Searching for multiple strings in packet payloads, approximate string matching, IP traceback via probabilistic marking, IP traceback via logging, detecting worms, etc. To execute the tasks there are many algorithms used. The search algorithms like Breadth First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS), Depth First Iterative Deepening (DFID) etc are used to traverse any network like graph or a tree. The performance of one search algorithm may be better than the performance of any other search algorithms for search a particular node of a network. The algorithms, like BFS, DFS and DFID can be used to traverse any tree like network entirely. But it is necessary to determine a best suitable algorithm to search the goal node instead of using any one of them randomly. Then the identified algorithm can be used to traverse the network to reach the goal node.

AB  - Passwords and PINs are convenient and ubiquitous, yet they are quite vulnerable to attackers who stand near the user. This problem may be partially resolved by changing the user interface, but previous solutions of this kind still give shoulder-surfing attackers a significant advantage over brute-force search. We propose a novel solution based on 3D, especially suitable for glasses-free 3D displays found in many smartphones and handheld game consoles. A user at the &#x201C;3D spot&#x201D; may log in easily, while nearby shoulder-surfers gain no advantage. We perform a detailed experimental analysis of the usability of our scheme.

AB  - Most large systems such as HPC/cloud computing clusters and data centers are built from commercial off-the-shelf components. System logs are usually the main source of choice to gain insights into the system issues. Therefore, mining logs to diagnose anomalies has been an active research area. Due to the lack of organization and semantic consistency in commodity PC clusters' logs, what constitutes a fault or an error is subjective and thus building an automatic failure prediction model from log messages is hard. In this paper we sidestep the difficulty by asking a different question: Given the concomitant system log messages of a running job, can we predict the job's remaining time? We adopt Hidden Markov Model (HMM) coupled with frequency analysis to achieve this. Our HMM approach can predict 75% of jobs' remaining times with an error of less than 200 seconds.

AB  - The component-based nature of large industrial software systems that consist of a number of diverse collaborating applications, pose significant challenges with respect to system maintenance, monitoring, auditing, and diagnosing. In this context, a monitoring and diagnostic system interprets log data to recognize patterns of significant events that conform to specific threat models. Threat models have been used by the software industry for analyzing and documenting a systempsilas risks in order to understand a systempsilas threat profile. In this paper, we propose a framework whereby patterns of significant events are represented as expressions of a specialized monitoring language that are used to annotate specific threat models. An approximate matching technique that is based on the Viterbi algorithm is then used to identify whether system generated events, fit the given patterns. The technique has been applied and evaluated considering threat models and monitoring policies in logs that have been obtained from multi-user MS-Windows based systems.

AB  - Intrusion detection systems alert the system administrators of intrusions but, in most cases, do not provide details about which system events are relevant to the intrusion and how the system events are related. We consider intrusions of file systems. Existing tools, like BackTracker, help the system administrator backtrack from the detection point, which is a file with suspicious contents, to possible entry points of the intrusion by providing a graph containing dependency information between the various files and processes that could be related to the detection point. We improve such backtracking techniques by logging certain additional parameters of the file system during normal operations (real-time) and examining the logged information during the analysis phase. In addition, we use dataflow analysis within the processes related to the intrusion to prune unwanted paths from the dependency graph. This results in significant reduction in search space, search time, and false positives. We also analyze the effort required in terms of storage space and search time.

AB  - Most people always want to get reliable information, even if there are intrusions that illegitimate hacker damages to file systems through operations modifying, appending, and deleting files. To accomplish this, we need the recovery function with transparent to user and return to its former state. This paper proposes design and implementation of a log-based intrusion recovery module (LBIRM). It can keep the previous contents of designated files as a chain of logs and recover the damaged file by using the log.

AB  - Organizations spend a significant amount of resources securing their servers and network perimeters. However, these mechanisms are not sufficient for protecting databases. In this paper, we present a new technique for identifying malicious database transactions. Compared to many existing approaches which profile SQL query structures and database user activities to detect intrusions, the novelty of this approach is the automatic discovery and use of essential data dependencies, namely, multi-dimensional and multi-level data dependencies, for identifying anomalous database transactions. Since essential data dependencies reflect semantic relationships among data items and are less likely to change than SQL query structures or database user behaviors, they are ideal for profiling data correlations for identifying malicious database activities.

AB  - In this paper we examine the possibilities for analyzing the behavior of library users. We point out that the softwares that we can use cannot fulfill library requirements. There are many data given for on-line searches in library systems hidden from the analyzers. After examining the possibilities and some log files produced by the library systems, we propose how log files could give more usable information for the semantic design of the intelligent library in the VirCA virtual collaboration system and of other on-line systems, too. These data can be applied as input information for intelligent systems in learning user searching behavior and help them predict user needs more precisely.

AB  - RoboCup is an international academic competition which has seen a rapid development in recent years. Generally, developers use the way of engineering to develop a team but ignore the log files of RoboCup Soccer. Data mining is used for knowledge discovering from mass data. In this paper, the method of Data Mining based on the log files will be used to design the initiative moving strategy. The results showed that the improved initiative moving strategy was successful and the way of using Data Mining method to analyze log files could improve the efficiency of development.

AB  - Today's system monitoring tools are capable of detecting system failures such as host failures, OS errors, and network partitions in near-real time. Unfortunately, the same cannot yet be said of the end-to-end distributed software stack. Any given action, for example, reliably transferring a directory of files, can involve a wide range of complex and interrelated actions across multiple pieces of software: checking user certificates and permissions, getting details for all files, performing third-party transfers, understanding re-try policy decisions, etc. We present an infrastructure for troubleshooting complex middleware, a general purpose technique for configurable log summarization, and an anomaly detection technique that works in near-real time on running Grid middleware. We present results gathered using this infrastructure from instrumented Grid middleware and applications running on the Emulab testbed. From these results, we analyze the effectiveness of several algorithms at accurately detecting a variety of performance anomalies.

AB  - Web usage mining (WUM) is a type of Web mining, which exploits data mining techniques to extract valuable information from navigation behavior of World Wide Web users. The data should be preprocessed to improve the efficiency and ease of the mining process. So it is important to define before applying data mining techniques to discover user access patterns from Web log. The main task of data preprocessing is to prune noisy and irrelevant data, and to reduce data volume for the pattern discovery phase. This paper mainly focus on data preprocessing stage of the first phase of Web usage mining with activities like field extraction and data cleaning algorithms. Field extraction algorithm performs the process of separating fields from the single line of the log file. Data cleaning algorithm eliminates inconsistent or unnecessary items in the analyzed data.

AB  - Classification using ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm provides a very good technique for users to understand the data obtained from event log files, which can further help in building a system profile and determining whether intrusions have taken place in the system. To evaluate the obstacle avoidance strategy, the parameters used are along the lines of simplicity of rules formed, number of terms present in the rules and also the predictive accuracy of the test data on the training set using the rules obtained. We have tried to analyze changes in the rule formation process for different thresholds, and for different times within the process of generating rules. We show through our evaluation that the obstacle avoidance strategy to ACO performs better than the popular ant-miner algorithm by building simple rules with an improved predictive accuracy.

AB  - Anomaly detection based on monitoring of sequences of system calls has proved to be an effective approach for detection of previously unknown attacks on programs. This paper describes a new model for profiling normal program behavior that can be used to detect intrusions that change application execution flow. The model (hybrid push down automaton, HPDA) incorporates call stack information and can be learned by dynamic analysis of training data captured from the call stack log. The learning algorithm uses call stack information maintained by the program to build a finite state automaton. When compared to other approaches including VtPath which also uses call stack information, the HPDA model produces a more compact and general representation of control flow, handles recursion naturally, can be learned with less training data, and has a lower false positive rate when used for anomaly detection. In addition, dynamic learning can also be used to supplement a model acquired from static analysis.

We demonstrate Nodeinfo's effectiveness on data from four of the world's most powerful supercomputers: using logs representing over 746 million processor-hours, in which anomalous events called alerts were manually tagged for scoring, we aim to automatically identify the regions of the log containing those alerts. We formalize the alert detection task in these terms, describe how Nodeinfo uses the information entropy of message terms to identify alerts, and present an online version of this algorithm, which is now in production use. This is the first work to investigate alert detection on (several) publicly-available supercomputer system logs, thereby providing a reproducible performance baseline.

AB  - The paper reports on an analysis technology based on the tracing approach to test trustworthy requirements of a distributed system. The system under test is instrumented such that it generates events at runtime to enable reasoning about the implementation of these requirements in a later step. Specifically, an event log collected during a system run is converted into a specification of the system. The (trustworthy) requirements of the system must be formally specified by an expert who has sufficient knowledge about the behaviour of the system. The reengineered model of the system and the requirement descriptions are then processed by an off-the-shelf model checker. The model checker generates scenarios that visualize fulfilments or violations of the requirements. A complex example of a concurrent system serves as a case study.

AB  - The healthcare industry has taken a significant pie in the information technology where a great progress is being shown in analyzing the research and development data collected over the years. Yet, most of the potential for value creation is still unclaimed. <sup>[1]</sup> In a typical healthcare system, the actual usage of the system can be determined when one transitions from the monitoring or a limited release phase of the project to the volume deployment mode. An early, if not a continuous feedback, can be ensured when the systems are usually beta tested at the selected sites. This is where we bring in the system log file analysis to play a major role in determining the reliability of the deployed system to receive an incessant and established feedback.

AB  - The convergence of voice and data on Internet Protocol (IP) networks has led to tremendous growth of Voice over IP (VoIP). While SIP/ H.323 are dominant signaling protocols, RTP is widely used for media transfer. Certain situations may require logging of RTP sessions along with the signaling information for call and voice analysis. Recovering voice from RTP packets requires explicit handling of RTP stack and decoding. In this paper, we propose a scheme that uses softphones with appropriate codec support for voice recovery from logged RTP packets. It is done using inherent provisions of RTP, specifically SSRC-multiplexing. The scheme also suggests the possibility of an active stream injection attack in RTP based VoIP.

AB  - Manual alert detection on modern high performance clusters (HPC) is cumbersome given their increasing complexity and size of their logs. The ability to automatically detect such alerts quickly and accurately with little or no human intervention is therefore desirable. The entropy-based approach of the Nodeinfo framework, which is in production use at Sandia National Laboratories, is one approach to automatic alert detection in HPC logs. In this work, we perform a comparative evaluation of three entropy based techniques, which are modifications to Nodeinfo. We evaluate these systems using three performance metrics, namely (i) Computational cost, (ii) detection accuracy, and (iii) false positive rate. Our results show that there is still room for improvement in entropy based approaches to the task of alert detection. We also show experimentally that it is possible to detect 100% of all alerts while maintaining an effective false positive rate of 0% using an entropy based approach. Our work suggests that entropy based approaches are viable for automatic alert detection in HPC and can improve the dependability of such systems if applied.

AB  - Cloud computing making ubiquitous influence in today's ever growing and on-demand IT world. Cloud delivers the next-generation computing paradigm that showcases the possibilities of apt resource sharing, true elasticity, and maximum resource utilization as compared to any of its early competitors. In addition to its technicality, corporates are also fascinated with its attractive tag of `pay-as-you-use' business model. After perceiving its advantages, many organizations fear in stepping into this modern computing technology, due to its severe security concerns. In today's world, whole business computing relies on the security of customers and their data. Consequently, due to the public and multi-tenancy nature of the cloud, security concerns and its velocity are huge in volume. eCloudIDS is a next-generation security system designed with innovative hybrid two-tier expert engines, namely uX-Engine and sX-Engine, which is considered as a most suitable security solution for cloud computing environments; precisely for public cloud. This paper explores the design and implementation of eCloudIDS architecture's Tier-1 iCloudIDM (formerly known as Behavioral Analyzer) Subsystem Layer-I (iCloudIDM-LI) through user-centric identity management approach.

AB  - Looking at current IDS and SIEM systems, we observe heavy processing power dedicated solely to answering a simple question, What is the format of the log line that the IDS (or SIEM) system should process next? Due to the apparent difficulties of uniquely identifying a log line at run-time, most systems today do little or no normalisation of the events they receive. Indeed these systems often rely on popular search engine applications for processing and analysing the event information they receive, which results in slower and far less accurate event correlations. In this process, a large list of tokenisers is usually created in order to find an answer to the above posted question. The tokenisers are run against the log lines, until a match is found. The appropriate log line can then be passed on to the correct extraction module for further processing. This process is currently the standard procedure of most IDS and SIEM systems. To address this problem and to optimise and improve the said process, this paper describes a method for detecting the exact type and format of a read log line in the first place. The method presented performs in an efficient manner, while it is less resource hungry. The proposed detection system is described and implemented, its pros and cons are analysed and weighed against methods currently implemented by popular IDS and SIEM systems for solving this task.

AB  - Masquerade attacks pose a serious threat for cloud system due to the massive amount of resource of these systems. Lack of datasets for cloud computing hinders the building of efficient intrusion detection of these attacks. Current dataset cannot be used due to the heterogeneity of user requirements, the distinct operating systems installed in the VMs, and the data size of Cloud systems. This paper presents a Cloud Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDD) that is the first one for cloud systems and that consists of both knowledge and behavior based audit data collected from both UNIX and Windows users. With respect to current datasets, CIDD has real instances of host and network based attacks and masquerades, and provides complete diverse audit parameters to build efficient detection techniques. The final statistic tables for each user are built by Log Analyzer and Correlator System (LACS) that parses and analyzes user's binary log files, and correlates audits data according to user IP address(es) and audit time. We describe in details the components and the architecture of LACS and CIDD, and the attacks distribution in CIDD.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the value of analyzing sequences of function calls for forensic analysis. Although this approach has been used for intrusion detection (that is, determining that a system has been attacked), its value in isolating the cause and effects of the attack has not previously been shown. We also look for not only the presence of unexpected events but also the absence of expected events. We tested these techniques using reconstructed exploits in su, ssh, and lpr, as well as proof-of-concept code, and, in all cases, were able to detect the anomaly and the nature of the vulnerability.

AB  - Intrusion detection is the process of identifying and responding to suspicious activities targeted at computing and communication resources, and it has become the mainstream of information assurance as the dramatic increase in the number of attacks. Intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors and collects data from a target system that should be protected, processes and correlates the gathered information, and initiates responses when evidence of an intrusion is detected. In this paper, we designed and implemented a host-based intrusion detection system, which combines two detection technologies, one is log file analysis technology and the other is BP neural network technology. Log file analysis is an approach of misuse detection, and BP neural network is an approach of anomaly detection. By combination of these two kinds of detection technologies, the HIDS that we have implemented can effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection.

AB  - The key barrier to widespread uptake of cloud computing is the lack of trust in clouds by potential customers. While preventive controls for security and privacy are actively researched, there is still little focus on detective controls related to cloud accountability and audit ability. The complexity resulting from large-scale virtualization and data distribution carried out in current clouds has revealed an urgent research agenda for cloud accountability, as has the shift in focus of customer concerns from servers to data. This paper discusses key issues and challenges in achieving a trusted cloud through the use of detective controls, and presents the Trust Cloud framework, which addresses accountability in cloud computing via technical and policy-based approaches.

AB  - Instruction-grain program monitoring tools, which check and analyze executing programs at the granularity of individual instructions, are invaluable for quickly detecting bugs and security attacks and then limiting their damage (via containment and/or recovery). Unfortunately, their fine-grain nature implies very high monitoring overheads for software-only tools, which are typically based on dynamic binary instrumentation. Previous hardware proposals either focus on mechanisms that target specific bugs or address only the cost of binary instrumentation. In this paper, we propose a flexible hardware solution for accelerating a wide range of instruction-grain monitoring tools. By examining a number of diverse tools (for memory checking, security tracking, and data race detection), we identify three significant common sources of overheads and then propose three novel hardware techniques for addressing these overheads: Inheritance Tracking, Idempotent Filters, and Metadata-TLBs. Together, these constitute a general-purpose hardware acceleration framework. Experimental results show our framework reduces overheads by 2-3X over the previous state-of-the-art, while supporting the needed flexibility.

AB  - In this paper, we determined the appropriate number of clusters and the proper amount of entries for applying K-means clustering to TCPdump data set using Apache Mahout/Hadoop framework. We aim at finding suitable configuration for efficiently analyzing large data set in limited amount of time. Our implementation applied Hadoop for large-scale log analysis with data set from KDD'99 competition as test data. With the distributed system framework, we can analyze a whole data set of KDD'99 by first applying our preprocessing. In addition, we use an anomaly detection model for log analysis. A key challenge is to make anomaly detection work more accurately. For the Kmeans algorithm, a key challenge is to set the appropriate number of the initial cluster (K). Moreover, we discuss whether the number of entries in log files affects the accuracy and detection rate of the system or not. Therefore, our implementation and experimental results describe the appropriate number of cluster and the proper amount of entries in log files. Finally, we show the result of our experiments with accuracy rate and number of initial cluster (K) graph, ROC curve and detection rate and false alarm rate table.

AB  - Contemporary information systems such as: eLearning, eUnivesity, eVoting, eHealth, etc., are frequently used and misused for irregular data changes (data tampering). Those facts force us to reconsider our security measures and find a way to improve them. Proving a computer crime act require very complicated processes which are based on digital evidence collecting, forensic analysis and investigation process. Forensic analysis of database systems is very specific and demanding task and therefore presents main inspiration for our research. In this paper we present the fact that classical methods of collecting digital evidence are not appropriate and efficient. In order to improve efficiency we propose combination of well know technology independent methods from database world and their application in field of forensic science. Also we are proposed some new research direction in this area.

AB  - Database is a major component of global information infrastructure. Thus securing these databases is very important thing. Thus, we develop an inference violation detection system to protect sensitive data content. Based on Knowledge acquisition, data dependency, database schema, and semantic knowledge, we constructed a semantic inference model (SIM) that represents the possible inference channels from any attribute to the pre-assigned sensitive attributes. The SIM is then instantiated to a semantic inference graph (SIG) for query-time inference violation detection. For a single user case, when a user poses a query, the detection system will examine users past query log and calculate the probability of inferring sensitive information. The query request will be denied if the inference probability exceeds the pre-specified threshold. For multiuser cases, the users may share their query answers to increase the inference probability. Therefore, we develop a model for evaluating collaborative inference based on the query sequences of collaborators and their task-sensitive collaboration levels. Experimental studies reveal that information authoritativeness, communication fidelity, and honesty in collaboration are three key factors that affect the level of achievable collaboration. In order to prevent an adversary from inferring information from a database, inference analyst must be able to detect and prevent possible inferences.

AB  - Protecting the database from malicious insider is the major challenge for the organizations now-a-days. The organizations are eager to adopt the advanced security solutions to prevent the theft of data. Most of the existing database IDS (intrusion detection system) apply high profile matching constraint. Due to this there is probability of high false positive rate. In this paper we propose a novel database IDS which reduces the false positive and false negative rates. This approach provides flexibility in profile matching constraint.

AB  - The openness of Android platform has attracted users, developers and attackers. Android offers bunch of capabilities and flexibilities, for instance, developers can write their own keyboard service-similar to Android soft keyboards-using the KeyboardView class. This class is available since api level 3.0 and can be part of the layout of an activity. Users prefer to download and install third-party keyboards that offer better experience and capabilities. However, there are security risks related to users installing and using these custom keyboards. Attackers can build or take advantage of existing third-party keyboards to create keyloggers to spy on smartphones users. Third-party keyboard once activated would substitute the Android standard keyboard, so all keys events pass this app. As results, many attacks can be launched identified by the permissions granted to these apps. The objective of this paper is to present these attacks, analyze their causes, and provide possible solutions.

AB  - Network intruders commonly use stolen passwords or other means to log into legitimate users' computer accounts. To prevent this from happening, it is important that we are able to distinguish a user as a true user or a masquerader. Uniqueness of user command has been used in the past as signature of users. This project explores the high frequency commands to see if they work well as signatures. Experimental result was provided to show that they work as well as the Uniqueness method. Besides, the comparisons with other methods were also presented.

AB  - Sharing personal information benefits both data providers and data consumers in many ways. Recent advances in sensor networks and personal archives enable users to record personal information including emails, social networking activities, or life events (life logging). These information objects are usually privacy sensitive and thus need to be protected adequately when being shared. In this work, we present a lightweight pseudonymization framework which allows users to benefit from sharing their personal information while still preserving their privacy. Furthermore, this approach increases the data owners' awareness of what information they are sharing, thus rendering data publishing more transparent.

This proposed model provides us a secured logging system which records the history of all the suspicious or malicious activities from the initiation of the Web service to the completion of the Web service. The main focus of this paper is to organize execution traces of Web services in a distributed computing paradigm in the form of a tree. One of the special characteristics of the model is that the execution traces of Web services can be retrieved from the coarse-grained level to the fine-grained level of the tree as per requirement.

This solution manages removable media through C/S model, registers mobile storage media used by user in the server, assigns a unique authorization number to authorize it can be used in trusted region; The client consists of the application and driver, the application is used to authorize mobile storage media and record the transaction log, then send control words to the driver after authentication, and the driver makes the mobile storage media at three states: read-only, disabled and normal. So it can control users use mobile storage media safely, prevent leakage of sensitive data in the network effectively.

AB  - Obtaining mutual nonrepudiation between the user and service provider is crucial in cloud storage. One of the solutions for mutual nonrepudiation is based on logging attestations, which are signed messages. For every request, clients and service provider exchange attestations. These attestations will be used in an auditing protocol to verify their behavior. The chain-hashing scheme chains attestations and stores them in service provider for supporting write serializability and read freshness of files. However, the chain-hashing scheme is inefficient when files in an account can be accessed by multiple client devices interchangeably. In this paper we first show that the chain-hashing scheme cannot resist roll-back attack from service provider unless client devices keep all the attestations or there exists a way to broadcast the last attestation to all the client devices. We propose a scheme that can guarantee mutual nonrepudiation between the user and service provider without requiring the client devices to exchange any messages, and each client device only has to store the last attestation it received. We also propose how to apply the hash tree to remove accumulated attestations. The results from related experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme. A service provider of cloud storage can use the proposed scheme to provide a mutual nonrepudiation guarantee in their service-level agreement.

AB  - As reliance on Internet connected systems expands, the threat of damage from malicious actors, especially undetected actors, rises. Masquerade attacks, where one individual or system poses as another, are among the most harmful and difficult to detect types of intrusion. Previous efforts to detect masquerade attacks have focused on host-based approaches, including command line, system call, and GUI interaction profiling but when host data is not accessible or legal/ethical restrictions apply, these methods are infeasible. In this work, we present an approach to masquerade detection using only basic network statistics. We use server log analysis to tag network events with the associated user and build user network profiles By utilizing only antagonized summary data, we limit the privacy impact of masquerade detection while avoiding the data accessibility issues associated with host-based approaches. We compile 90 days of NetFlow data from over 50 users and show the user profile are unique, and likely useful for detecting masqueraders. Finally, we apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to demonstrate feasibility of masquerade detection using network data.

AB  - Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) examine millions of network packets searching for malicious traffic. Multi-gigabit line-speeds combined with growing databases of rules lead to dropped packets as the load exceeds the capacity of the device. Several areas of research have attempted to mitigate this problem through improving packet inspection efficiency, increasing resources, or reducing the examined population. A popular method for reducing the population examined is to employ run-time filters that can provide a quick check to determine that a given network packet cannot match a particular rule set. While this technique is an excellent method for reducing the population under examination, rogue elements can trivially bypass such filters with specially crafted packets and render the run-time filters effectively useless. Since the filtering comes at the cost of extra processing a filtering solution could actually perform worse than a non-filtered solution under such pandemic circumstances. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to consider run-time filters as an independent anomaly detector capable of detecting attacks against itself. Such anomaly detection, together with judicious rate-limiting of traffic forwarded to full packet inspection, allows the detection, logging, and mitigation of attacks targeted at the filters while maintaining the overall improvements in NIDS performance garnered from using run-time filters.

AB  - Network communication has become indispensable in business, education and government. With the pervasive role of the Internet as a means of sharing information across networks, its misuse for destructive purposes, such as spreading malicious code, compromising remote hosts, or damaging data through unauthorized access, has grown immensely in the recent years. The classical way of monitoring the operation of large network systems is by analyzing the system logs for detecting anomalies. In this work, we introduce hierarchical network map, an interactive visualization technique for gaining a deeper insight into network flow behavior by means of user-driven visual exploration. Our approach is meant as an enhancement to conventional analysis methods based on statistics or machine learning. We use multidimensional modeling combined with position and display awareness to view source and target data of the hosts in a hierarchical fashion with the ability to interactively change the level of aggregation or apply filtering. The interdisciplinary approach integrating data warehouse technology, information visualization and decision support brings about the benefit of efficiently collecting the input data and aggregating over very large data sets, visualizing the results and providing interactivity to facilitate analytical reasoning

AB  - Insider threats cause serious damage to data in any organization and is considered as a grave issue. In spite of the presence of threat prevention mechanisms, insiders can continue to attack a database by figuring out the dependency relationships among data items. Thus, examining write operations performed by an insider by taking advantage of dependencies aids in mitigating insider threats. We have developed two attack prevention models, which involve logs and dependency graphs respectively, to monitor data items and prevent malicious operations on them. The developed algorithms have been implemented on a simulated database and the results show that the models effectively mitigate insider threats arising from write operations.

AB  - To detect and investigate self-propagating worm attacks against networked servers, the following capabilities are desirable: 1) raising timely alerts to trigger a worm investigation, 2) determining the break-in point of a worm, i.e., the vulnerable service from which the worm infiltrates the victim, and 3) identifying all contaminations inflicted by the worm during its residence in the victim. In this paper, we argue that the worm break-in provenance information has not been exploited in achieving these capabilities and thus propose process coloring, a new approach that preserves worm break-in provenance information and propagates it along operating- system-level information flows. More specifically, process coloring assigns a "color," a unique systemwide identifier, to each remotely accessible server process. The color will be either inherited by spawned child processes or diffused transitively through process actions. Process coloring achieves three new capabilities: color-based worm warning generation, break-in point identification, and log file partitioning. The virtualization-based implementation enables more tamper-resistant log collection, storage, and real-time monitoring. Beyond the overhead introduced by virtualization, process coloring only incurs very small additional system overhead. Experiments with real-world worms demonstrate the advantages of processing coloring over non-provenance-preserving tools.

AB  - Web attacks are increases both magnitude and complexity. In this paper, we try to use the Shannon entropy analysis to detect these attacks. Our approach examines web access logging text using the principle that web attacking scripts usually have more sophisticated request patterns than legitimate ones. Risk level of attacking incidents are indicated by the average (AVG) and standard deviation (SD) of each entropy period, i.e., Alpha and Beta lines which are equal to AVG-SD and AVG-2*SD, respectively. They represent boundaries in detection scheme. As the result, our technique is not only used as high accurate procedure to investigate web request anomaly behaviors, but also useful to prune huge application access log files and focus on potential intrusive events. The experiments show that our proposed process can detect anomaly requests in web application system with proper effectiveness and low false alarm rate.

AB  - Learning environments aim to deliver efficacious instruction, but rarely take into consideration the motivational factors involved in the learning process. However, motivational aspects like engagement play an important role in effective learning-engaged learners gain more. E-Learning systems could be improved by tracking students' disengagement that, in turn, would allow personalized interventions at appropriate times in order to reengage students. This idea has been exploited several times for Intelligent Tutoring Systems, but not yet in other types of learning environments that are less structured. To address this gap, our research looks at online learning-content-delivery systems using educational data mining techniques. Previously, several attributes relevant for disengagement prediction were identified by means of log-file analysis on HTML-Tutor, a web-based learning environment. In this paper, we investigate the extendibility of our approach to other systems by studying the relevance of these attributes for predicting disengagement in a different e-learning system. To this end, two validation studies were conducted indicating that the previously identified attributes are pertinent for disengagement prediction, and two new meta-attributes derived from log-data observations improve prediction and may potentially be used for automatic log-file annotation.

AB  - The online learning gains more popularity in recent days; its key success is delivering content over internet and can be accessed by students from anywhere and anytime. In general, attraction is the quality of arousing interest. Similarly, motivation is the other hand to support for learning. Since, the online learning has less control over students compared to the conventional teaching method. Therefore engagement of student gets more importance on online learning. Most of the learning systems stores learners activities in log files and their profile related informations in database. Usually log file analysis alone could not have enough data to find out disengagement. Thus we integrate the log file information with database and develop a novel disengagement detection strategy using quasi framework. This study result reveals that quasi framework is effective in term of quality compared to previous proposals.

AB  - Publicly Posted Composite Documents (PPCDs) address the problem of composite documents with different formats and varied sensitivity participating in cross-organizational workflows distributed over potentially non-secure channels. An early version of the PPCD, however, is susceptible to silent workflow termination, wherein a document shipped by one workflow participant is never received by the subsequent participant, causing the workflow to terminate without notification. In the current paper, we extend the PPCD solution to provide an early detection mechanism for a potential workflow termination, to provide workflow recovery procedures, and to provide for the often mandatory document logging and audit information.

AB  - Masqueraders commonly impersonate legitimate userpsilas account to gain access to computer systems that they are not authorized to enter. Normally users exhibit some regularity in their behavior such as command usage. We propose a new approach to mine user command associations. Since each user may have different usage behavior, using the built behavior pattern to predict a masqueraderpsilas next command will result in low success rate. We devise an algorithm to identify masqueraders by evaluating the accuracy of the predictions. Furthermore our detection method can be used in real-time without having to wait for a log of a large number of commands. Experimental results show that the association rules mining performs very well in detecting masqueraders.

AB  - Web is one of the most popular internet services in today's world. In today's world, web servers and web based applications are the popular corporate applications and become the targets of the attackers. A Large number of Web applications, especially those deployed for companies to e-business operation involve high reliability, efficiency and confidentiality. Such applications are written in script languages like PHP embedded in HTML allowing establish the connection to databases, retrieving data and putting them in WWW site. In order to detect known attacks, misuse detection of web based attacks consists of attack rules and descriptions. As misuse detection considers predefined signatures for intrusion detection, here we have proposed two phases of intrusion detection mechanism. In the first phase we have used web host based intrusion detection with matching mechanism using 'Hamming Edit Distance'. We have considered here. the web layer log file for matching. This phase has been tested with our university intranet web server's log file. We have tested successfully the SQL injection for unauthorized access. We proposed a 'Query based projected clustering' for unsupervised anomaly detection and also a 'packet arrival factor' for intrusion detection in the second phase. We tested the scheme in this phase using KDD CUP99. In this phase while testing our scheme, we have extracted the feature dataset with protocol 'tcp' and services 'http'. Both the phases of our scheme found working successfully and an evaluated threshold has been proposed for better result.

The framework can develop models of Web usage from Web server logs in a data driven fashion and the actual traffic is generated by employing the Web browser installed on the host. Additionally, we employed an intrusion detection system as a traffic analyzer to validate the synthetic data that the framework generated and compared it against the standard intrusion detection system benchmark data, namely KDD 99 datasets.

AB  - Visualization and situational awareness are of vital importance for power systems, as the earlier a power-system event such as a transmission line fault or cyber-attack is identified, the quicker operators can react to avoid unnecessary loss. Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.

AB  - When prosecuting crimes, the main question to answer is often who had a motive and the possibility to commit the crime. When investigating cyber crimes, the question of possibility is often hard to answer, as in a networked system almost any location can be accessed from almost anywhere. The most common tool to answer this question, analysis of log files, faces the problem that the amount of logged data may be overwhelming. This problems gets even worse in the case of insider attacks, where the attacker's actions usually will be logged as permissible, standard actions-if they are logged at all. Recent events have revealed intimate knowledge of surveillance and control systems on the side of the attacker, making it often impossible to deduce the identity of an inside attacker from logged data. In this work we present an approach that analyses the access control configuration to identify the set of credentials needed to reach a certain location in a system. This knowledge allows to identify a set of (inside) actors who have the possibility to commit an insider attack at that location. This has immediate applications in analysing log files, but also non-technical applications such as identifying possible suspects, or, beyond cyber crimes, picking the "best" actor for a certain task. We also sketch an online analysis that identifies where an actor can be located based on observed actions.

We present and discuss a hypergeometric process model that describes such attack patterns. We used web request signatures from the logs of a production web server to assess the applicability of the model.

AB  - With the growing of network technology along with the need of human for social interaction, using websites nowadays becomes critically important which leads in the increasing number of websites and servers. One popular solution for managing these large numbers of websites is using shared web hosting servers in order to decrease the overall cost of server maintenance. Despite affordability, this solution is insecure and risky according to high amount of reported defaces and attacks during recent years. In this paper, we introduce top ten most common attacks in shared web hosting servers which can occur because of the nature and bad configuration in these servers. Moreover, we present several simple scenarios that are capable of penetrating these kinds of servers even with the existence of several securing mechanisms. Finally, we provide a comprehensive secure configuration for confronting these attacks.

The fundamental mechanisms employed in this approach includes: (1) The separation of execution and state management, which enables the use of a single process to manage application requests, thereby reducing runtime overhead and enables highly concurrent executions. (2) The append-only logging policy, which protects the state of the system against an intrusion attack and ensures a clean state for the system to fallback on during recovery. (3) The use of acceptance testing as a way of verifying the integrity of the execution of application requests.

AB  - Flash-crowd DDoS attacks - in which the attacking bots aim to appear indistinguishable from the regular visitors to the victim web-site - have only recently been identified in the literature. While generally seen as the most advanced and most potent type of DDoS, flash crowd attacks are only partially understood, and their practical viability is still very much unclear. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that takes the perspective of a potential attacker interested in executing a flash crowd DDoS, and looks at the challenges of designing a botnet that would carry out that execution effectively. The results of our study demonstrate that, through the use of some popular readily available Internet tools, the attacker is likely to succeed in harvesting critical information about any perspective victim site, and thus be in the position to customize his bots (i.e., make them behave very close to how a typical human visitor to the given site would behave). Clearly, better bot customization would imply more powerful and harder-to-defend-against DDoS attacks.

AB  - This paper describes the components that constitute a contemporary web analytics application and discusses the impact and the implications of the technology paradigm shift towards rich Internet applications (RIAs) on web analytics applications in Web 2.0. The performance and behavioral measuring mechanisms collect data from various source points. These sources depend heavily on the implementation characteristics of each web application. For example, while the amount of detail data registered in the access log file (ALF) by the web server is sufficient for any non RIA application, it is heavily reduced for any RIA, since the model of interaction between client and server is heavily shifted towards the client [1]. In RIAs most processing and preparation of data is performed locally, at the client site by the browser, so the client handles all key clicks, as well as the main interaction with the user interface of the application. Communication with the server mainly covers transfers and requests of data to and from the database of the web application. The two basic technologies used for analytics, tagging and log file analysis are described and discussed. A hybrid solution that addresses the issue of the reduced ALF is proposed. Additionally extraction techniques for specific crucial data needed in order to scrutinize the performance operationally, as well as from the business perspective of the web application enriches the analyzer's database and provides measurements and data using terms and descriptions familiar to the operational personnel.

AB  - Creating a self-organizing system of agents to defend large cyber infrastructures presents many challenges, one of which is demonstrating the system without trying to host it on a large real net-work of tens of thousands of machines. This abstract describes a portable demonstration of PNNL's Ant-Based Cyber Defense (ABCD) that can run on one or a few physical machines with sufficient resources. We have chosen to run the framework on hundreds of virtual machines whose number is limited only by the available memory and processing power. We collect the distributed logs and visualize the results on a large-scale visualization created to represent up to a million nodes. Our approach should be useful for other decentralized adaptive and self-organizing systems that span large numbers of physical machines.

AB  - In this paper a plagiarism detection framework is proposed based on coding style. Furthermore, the typical style-based approach is improved to better detect plagiarism in programming codes. The plagiarism detection is performed in two phases: in the first phase the main features representing a coding style are extracted. In the second phase the extracted features are used in three different modules to detect the plagiarized codes and to determine the giver and takers of the codes. The extracted features for each code developer are kept in a history log, i.e. a user profile as his/her style of coding, and would be used to determine the change in coding style. The user profile allows the system to detect if a code is truly developed by the claimed developer or it is written by another person, having another style. Furthermore, the user profile allows determining the code giver and code taker when two codes are similar by comparing the codes' styles with the style of the programmers. Also if a code is copied from the internet or developed by a third party, then the style of who claims the ownership of the code is normally less proficient in coding than the third party and can be detected. The difference between the style levels is done through the style level checker module in the proposed framework. The proposed framework has been implemented and tested and the results are compared to Moss which shows comparable performance in detecting plagiarized codes.

AB  - Companies have gradually abandoned internally developed enterprise applications in favor of commercial ones. These systems are often comprised of different, multi-vendor components, including, Web servers, databases and applications. For most organizations, performance problems are often addressed by acquiring larger servers or increasing network bandwidth. While the performance of an individual component or application can be and is analyzed, the overall performance of the integrated suite of applications remains largely ad hoc and determining the cause of problems becomes trial and error. We report on initial work to address these problems by studying a commercial enterprise application, understanding what information is important, how such information can be gathered and analyzed and what kinds of tools would be beneficial. We report on an analysis tool and some results of using that tool and on the potential of the approach and methodology for larger enterprise environments.

However, with these advances come some costs: cloud data is often stored and manipulated by remote machines that users have no access to. Moreover, cloud service providers often claim that their data is safe and secure, but users rarely have ways to make sure. Based on recent academic and industrial research, this paper surveys various approaches cloud service companies can make to ensure proper accountability. The paper focuses on issues such as cloud accountability framework, data confidentiality, and user privacy. More importantly, we also put forth some efficiency advice.

AB  - A block-level continuous data protection (CDP) system logs every disk update to a network storage server it protects, so as to support more flexible recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO). To provide efficient access to historical snapshots, block-level CDP systems maintain multiple index structures, each of which needs to be updated whenever a disk block update operation is logged. Because these index structures are too large to be held in memory, updating their on-disk versions in real time becomes a major performance bottleneck that prevents existing CDP systems from scaling to large data backup applications. This paper describes the design and implementation of a high-performance index update mechanism that logs index updates, batches them in memory, and commits them using mostly sequential disk I/O. Sequential commit greatly reduces the cost of bringing in and writing back each on-disk index page. Update batching further amortizes this cost over multiple index update operations. Empirical performance measurements demonstrate that the proposed technique improves the index update throughput by more than an order of magnitude and reduces the performance overhead associated with index updates from 95% to under 15%.

AB  - MapReduce enables parallel and distributed processing of vast amount of data on a cluster of machines. However, such computing paradigm is subject to threats posed by malicious and cheating nodes or compromised user submitted code that could tamper data and computation since users maintain little control as the computation is carried out in a distributed fashion. In this paper, we focus on the analysis and detection of anomalies during the process of MapReduce computation. Accordingly, we develop a computational provenance system that captures provenance data related to MapReduce computation within the MapReduce framework in Hadoop. In particular, we identify a set of invariants against aggregated provenance information, which are later analyzed to uncover anomalies indicating possible tampering of data and computation. We conduct a series of experiments to show the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed provenance system.

AB  - Operational network data, management data such as customer care call logs and equipment system logs, is a very important source of information for network operators to detect problems in their networks. Unfortunately, there is lack of efficient tools to automatically track and detect anomalous events on operational data, causing ISP operators to rely on manual inspection of this data. While anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of network data, operational data presents several new challenges, including the volatility and sparseness of data, and the need to perform fast detection (complicating application of schemes that require offline processing or large/stable data sets to converge). To address these challenges, we propose Tiresias, an automated approach to locating anomalous events on hierarchical operational data. Tiresias leverages the hierarchical structure of operational data to identify high-impact aggregates (e.g., locations in the network, failure modes) likely to be associated with anomalous events. To accommodate different kinds of operational network data, Tiresias consists of an online detection algorithm with low time and space complexity, while preserving high detection accuracy. We present results from two case studies using operational data collected at a large commercial IP network operated by a Tier-1 ISP: customer care call logs and set-top box crash logs. By comparing with a reference set verified by the ISP's operational group, we validate that Tiresias can achieve &gt;;94% accuracy in locating anomalies. Tiresias also discovered several previously unknown anomalies in the ISP's customer care cases, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Nowadays, spam is very much allied with a huge chunk of data transferred through internet involving all disturbing and unsolicited contents received via different web-services such as chat systems, e-mail, forums and web logs. In this paper, we have reviewed various past research works of filtering SPAM and propose a novel filtering technique for SPAM especially for chat system with the support of classical rough set theory. Simulation results clearly indicate that our proposed method, can achieve higher accuracy in spam detection as compared to the existing strategies.

This paper proposes the application of a Bayesian approach to robot detection based on characteristics of user sessions. The method is applied to the Web traffic from a real e-commerce site. Results show that the classification model based on the cluster analysis with the Ward's method and the weighted Euclidean metric is very effective in robot detection, even obtaining accuracy of above 90%.

The usability studies were performed using the WebHint method for usability analysis of web applications. We evaluate two different versions of the application in order to observe the applicability of the method for successive usability analysis. The results show how the WebHint method can be used as an alternative approach to carry out successive evaluations of the usability of an application in order to analyze the evolution of different versions of its interface.

Since its introduction in 2001 by one of the authors of this paper, Simple Event Correlator (SEC) has become a widely used open source event correlation tool. During the last decade, a number of papers have been published that describe the use of SEC in various environments. However, recent SEC versions have introduced a number of novel features not discussed in existing works. This paper fills this gap and provides an up-to-date coverage of best practices for creating scalable SEC configurations.

AB  - Recovery from information attacks is difficult because DBMS is not designed to deal with malicious committed transactions. A few existing methods developed for this purpose rely on operation logs, which can't express the dependency between different transactions directly. These methods usually use rollback mechanism and abandon results of innocent transactions to maintain correctness, which may indeed be used as an approach to realize DOS attack. Hence, it's necessary to find out the malicious transaction and subsequent transactions depending on it precisely. In this paper, the definition of transaction recovery log is presented and each log item records the actions taken in one transaction, by which, we can calculate transactions' dependency directly. Based on the log model and the algorithm for log's creation, the dependency calculation and data recovery algorithm are studied, which are proofed to be complete and correct. Using transaction recovery log and the algorithm, database system can significantly enhance the performance of recovery for defensive information warfare.

AB  - Sharing data within grid environments always results in losing control over data usage. If the shared information is medical data, this violates laws as specified in HIPAA, because access to such data must be reconstructible and needs to be tightly controlled. To comply with these regulations it must be guaranteed, that each data access and modification is recorded to produce audit trails. The provided solution introduces a new concept for virtual grid computing environments consisting of secure virtual machines, hosting data and indemnifying thorough audit trails by logging every data interaction, solving the problem of traceability and side-access.

AB  - Download accelerator plus (DAP) is one of the most popular download managers due to its free availability, download speed and versatility. This software records download activities across multiple files which include history, registry, RAM, swap and temporary files. This paper analyzes (a) the log files (with .DAT extension), (b) windows registry entries, and (c) RAM and swap files from forensic view point. We also look at tools and techniques for extracting evidence. This research work describes a number of traces left behind after the use of DAP such as install location, download path, downloaded files and menu extensions to name a few, enabling digital investigators to search and interpret download activities. Moreover the study is supported by a tool, DAP forensic artefact collector (DAPFAC), that assists forensic examiners by providing valuable information which is retrieved from the windows registry and history files on the basis of analysis performed. The widespread use of DAP makes this analysis, an attractive option, ranging from law enforcement agencies to employees monitoring manager.

AB  - Network traffic logs play an important role in incident analysis. With the increasing throughput of network links, maintaining a complete log of all network activity has become a task that requires an enormous amount of resources. We propose an approach to network monitoring that mitigates the resource consumption problem while still providing effective support to evidence collection and incident analysis. The approach relies on a tool, called MNEMOSYNE, that maintains a sliding window containing the traffic that has been recently seen on a network link. MNEMOSYNE provides improved logging features, such as multiple streams, support for cross-stream queries, and dynamic remote reconfiguration. By integrating MNEMOSYNE with real-time intrusion detection capability, it is possible to provide incident analysis functionality and effective evidence collection, without having to maintain complete traffic logs. This paper describes the MNEMOSYNE tool, its architecture, and presents the results of the quantitative evaluation of its performance.

AB  - The task of sifting through large amounts of data to find useful information spawned the field of data mining. Most data mining approaches are based on machine-learning techniques, numerical analysis, or statistical modeling. They use human interaction and visualization only minimally. Such automatic methods can miss some important features of the data. Incorporating human perception into the data mining process through interactive visualization can help us better understand the complex behaviors of computer network systems. This article describes visual-analytics-based solutions and outlines a visual exploration process for log analysis. Three log-file analysis applications demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in discovering flaws and intruders in network systems.

AB  - Intrusion detection system (IDS) has played an important role as a device to defend our networks from cyber attacks. However, since it still suffers from detecting an unknown attack, i.e., 0-day attack, the ultimate challenge in intrusion detection field is how we can exactly identify such an attack. Unlike the existing approaches that investigate raw traffic data, we introduced a feature extraction method in order to detect such an attack from IDS alerts [J. Song et al., 2007]. However, there is a problem that it can be only applied to limited IDS products. In this paper, we present a generalized version of the feature extraction method. To this end, we define new 7 features using only the basic 6 features of IDS alerts; detection time, source address and port, destination address and port, and signature name. In order to detect 0-day attack from IDS alerts with new 7 features, we apply an unsupervised learning technique, One-class SVM, to them. We evaluated our method over the log data of IDS that is deployed in Kyoto University, and our experimental results show that it has capability to detect not only a type of 0-day attack detected in our previous study, but also several different types of 0-day attack.

AB  - Surprisingly few data collection mechanisms have been used for intrusion detection, and most systems rely on network and system call data as input to the detection engine. Even though the quality of log data is vital to the detection process and heavily dependent on the collection mechanism, no extensive survey or taxonomy has been conducted within the detection field. In this paper, we propose a revised taxonomy which provides a unified terminology and a framework in which data collection mechanisms can be systematically inspected, evaluated, and compared. Since the taxonomy is derived from existing mechanisms, it also provides a useful overview of different types of mechanisms. The paper also suggests areas within data collection where additional work is required.

AB  - A technique for visualizing intrusion-detection system log files using hierarchical data based on IP addresses represents the number of incidents for thousands of computers in one display space. Our technique applies a hierarchical data visualization technique that represents leaf nodes as black square icons and branch nodes as rectangular borders enclosing the icons. This representation style visualizes thousands of hierarchical data leaf nodes equally in one display space. We applied the technique to bioactive chemical visualization and job distribution in parallel-computing environments.

AB  - As computer and network intrusions become more and more of a concern, the need for better capabilities to assist in the detection and analysis of intrusions also increases. We propose a methodology for analyzing network and computer log information visually based on the analysis of user behavior. Each user's behavior is the key to determining their intent and overriding goals, whether they attempt to hide their actions or not. Proficient hackers will attempt to hide their ultimate goal, which hinders the reliability of log file analysis. Visually analyzing the user's behavior, however, is much more adaptable and difficult to counteract. This paper will discuss how user behavior can be exhibited within the visualization techniques, the capabilities provided by the environment, typical characteristics users should look out for (i.e., how unusual behavior exhibits itself), and exploration paradigms effective for identifying the meaning behind the user's behavior.

AB  - In an earlier paper (Chen et al., 2000), we proposed a steganography scheme for hiding a piece of critical information in a host binary image. That scheme ensures that, in each m &times; n image block of the host image, as many as [log<sub>2</sub> (mn + 1)] bits can be hidden in the block by changing at most 2 bits in the block. We propose a new scheme that improves (Chen et al., 2000) in its capability to maintain higher quality of the host image after data hiding by sacrificing some data hiding space. The new scheme can still offer a good data hiding ratio. It ensures that, for any bit that is modified in the host image, the bit is adjacent to another bit which has a value equal to the former's new value. Thus, the hiding effect is quite invisible

AB  - We propose a methodology for utilizing network management systems for the early detection of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Although there are quite a large number of events that are prior to an attack (e.g. suspicious log-ons, start of processes, addition of new files, sudden shifts in traffic, etc.), in this work we depend solely on information from MIB (management information base) traffic variables collected from the systems participating in the attack. Three types of DDoS attacks were effected on a research test bed, and MIB variables were recorded. Using these datasets, we show how there are indeed MIB-based precursors of DDoS attacks that render it possible to detect them before the target is shut down. Most importantly, we describe how the relevant MIB variables at the attacker can be extracted automatically using statistical tests for causality. It is shown that statistical tests applied in the time series of MIB traffic at the target and the attacker are effective in extracting the correct variables for monitoring in the attacker machine. Following the extraction of these key variables at the attacker, it is shown that an anomaly detection scheme, based on a simple model of the normal rate of change of the key MIBs can be used to determine statistical signatures of attacking behavior. These observations suggest the possibility of an entirely automated procedure centered on network management systems for detecting precursors of distributed denial of service attacks, and responding to them

AB  - When computer intrusions occur, one of the most costly, time-consuming, and human-intensive tasks is the analysis and recovery of the compromised system. At a time when the cost of human resources dominates the cost of CPU, network, and storage resources, we argue that computing systems should, in fact, be built with automated analysis and recovery as a primary goal. Towards this end, we describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of Forensix: a robust, high-precision reconstruction and analysis system for supporting the computer equivalent of "TiVo". Forensix uses three key mechanisms to improve the accuracy and reduce the human overhead of performing forensic analysis. First it performs comprehensive monitoring of the execution of a target system at the kernel event level, giving a high-resolution, application-independent view of all activity. Second, it streams the kernel event information, in real-time, to append-only storage on a separate, hardened, logging machine, making the system resilient to a wide variety of attacks. Third, it uses database technology to support high-level querying of the archived log, greatly reducing the human cost of performing forensic analysis.

AB  - The design of a mandatory access control (MAC) mechanism for the Unix file system is described. The design is simple, compatible with AT&amp;T's Systems V and Berkeley's BSD Unix with Sun Microsystem's Network File System support, and it avoids some of the deficiencies present in approaches done to date. The MAC design introduces the concept of file name hiding. The design eliminates the need for partitioned directories and the need to log out and then log in again to use upgraded directories. The author briefly describes the traditional Unix file system. Approaches to adding a mandatory access control mechanism to the Unix file system are detailed, and problems with the approaches are examined. Finally, the proposed approach is described, including an explanation of how it solves the deficiencies of the previous approaches

AB  - Attacks and misuses of computer systems are major concerns in today's network-based world. With the growing concern with regard to cyberterrorism there is a need for new tools and techniques to monitor networks and systems for intrusions and misuse. The goal must be to identify an attack before an organization incurs damage, loses information (theft or otherwise), or has its integrity impugned. With today's network-based economic resources, a successful attack will negatively impact consumer confidence and decrease consumers' willingness to make electronic purchases. The authors present information visualization techniques based on a glyph metaphor for visually representing textual log information

AB  - The early detection of multistage attacks like DDoS and coordinated spamming poses a major challenge for existing counter-measures based on reactive blacklists. One approach to addressing this challenge would be to profile hosts that engage in scanning activity and predict their future actions. However, this requires understanding how hosts evolve their scanning behaviour. In order to address this issue we have analysed logs from the DShield repository of globally distributed IDS alerts corresponding to the first 15 days of January 2005. We first clustered hosts using similarities in the spatial breadth (targeted DShield subscribers) and depth (targeted destination ports) of their scanning activity during aggregation intervals of one day at a time. We then analysed temporal properties like popularity, volatility, lifetime and transition of these clusters to infer how they evolved over time. We found persistent clusters with stable sizes. However, they were highly volatile with a consistent turn-over of hosts everyday. This was caused by the lifetime of hosts in each cluster mostly being one day. Nevertheless, we came across a non-trivial number of hosts that appeared everyday while belonging to the same cluster or transitioning from one cluster to another. Based on these findings, it is plausible that suspicious hosts can be profiled for long periods of time to predict an imminent multistage attack.

Kernel files of OS is frangible against intruders and virus, we can log suspicious events that access the kernel, and the threaten level of each event can be defined. By mining and analyzing the data in log, using the theory of evidence, we can calculate the risk level for the whole host system. On the base of the evaluation result, the administrator can decide to enhance or lower the host defense level.

AB  - Syslog audit acts an important role in keeping host secure. This paper studied Host-based syslog, and constructed a secure state model for host performing normally from the angle of anomaly detection. Through deep research on syslog protocol, a log collection tool was created for collecting remote or local host syslog. Because different segments of syslog imply different system information, the model separated every segment from a syslog record with Regular Expression, then it made data preprocessing and statistic with rule matching, in the end it conducted analysis by BP (Back Propagation) NN (Neural Network). The result indicates that not only can it achieve Host-based intrusion and anomaly detection, but also it is a high efficient and intelligent method.

AB  - The authors present the results of a long-term user study of site-based login mechanisms that train users to log in safely. Interactive site-identifying images received 70 percent detection rates, which is significantly better than the 20 percent received by the typical login ceremony. They also found that combining login bookmarks with interactive images and nonworking buttons or links (called negative training functions) achieved the best detection rates (82 percent) and overall resistance rates (93 percent). Because interactive custom images provide effective user training against phishing, the authors extended its authentication usages. The authors present an adaptive authentication mechanism based on recognition of multiple custom images, which can be used for different Web and mobile authentication scenarios. The mechanism relies on memorization of the custom images on each primary login, adaptively increasing the authentication difficulty on detection of impersonation attacks, and recognizing all images for fallback authentication.

AB  - Intrusion detection (ID) has become an important technology for protecting information resources and databases from malicious attacks and information leakage. This paper proposes a novel two-layer mechanism to detect intrusions against a web-based database service. Layer one builds historical profiles based on audit trails and other log data provided by the web server and database server. Pre-alarms will be triggered if anomalies occurred. Layer two makes further analysis on the pre-alarms generated from Layer one. Such methods integrates the alarm context with the alarms themselves rather than a simple "analysis in isolation". This can reduce the error rates, especially false positives and greatly improve the accuracy of intrusion detection, alarm notification and hence more effective incident handling

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of tracing intruders who obscure their identity by logging through a chain of multiple machines. After discussing previous approaches to this problem, we introduce thumbprints which are short summaries of the content of a connection. These can be compared to determine whether two connections contain the same text and are therefore likely to be part of the same connection chain. We enumerate the properties a thumbprint needs to have to work in practice, and then define a class of local thumbprints which have the desired properties. A methodology from multivariate statistics called principal component analysis is used to infer the best choice of thumbprinting parameters from data. Currently our thumbprints require 24 bytes per minute per connection. We develop an algorithm to compare these thumbprints which allows for the possibility that data may leak from one time-interval to the next. We present experimental data showing that our scheme works on a local area network

AB  - In the context of computer systems, an intrusion is generally considered to be a harmful endeavor to prevent others from legitimate use of that system, to obtain data which is not normally available to the intruder, or to plant data or disrupt data already existent on the machines. Traditionally intrusion detection has relied on two data sources: various log files which record user's activity, and network traffic which contains potential threats. This research presents a system which we call IDEA; the Intrusion DEtection Automata system. We utilize a third source of data for intrusion detection in the form of an instrumented process. Open source software is recompiled using a modified compiler we have created, and the resulting executable program generates the data as it runs. An external monitoring facility then checks the behavior of the program against known good execution paths. These paths are specified either using a domain specific language and hand-written rules, or by running the software in a learning mode and capturing the normal behavior for later comparison.

AB  - External threats to the cyber-infrastructure of an organization are constantly evolving. The greatest threat, however, is the problem of insiders who misuse their privileges for malicious purposes. These days, private information has often been leaked because of increased IT outsourcing, administrator's moral problems, multiple root accounts, and root accounts shared by many users, etc. Accordingly, organizations have employed insider attack detection systems to protect their critical information from break-ins by insider attack and hackers. In this paper, we developed an integrated insider attack detection system which was composed of a minimized hardware appliance and a software package using TCP tunneling. It could be configured as a gateway between users and the legacy servers in order to protect the important internal information in the legacy servers. And it could control the access of users on the servers, who were connected by Telnet or FTP, and would block the theft of confidential information using intelligent packet filtering. Also, it should provide an audit using the packet logging on the legacy servers.

AB  - In an earlier paper, we propose a steganography scheme for hiding a piece of critical information in a host binary image. That scheme ensures that in each m&times;n image block of the host image, as many as [log<sub>2</sub>(mn+1)] bits can be hidden in the block by changing at most 2 bits in the block. As a sequel of that work, in this paper we propose a revised scheme that can maintain higher quality of the host image by sacrificing some data hiding space. The new scheme can still offer a good data hiding ratio. It ensures that for any bit that is modified in the host image, the bit is adjacent to another bit which has a value equal to the former's new value. Thus, the hiding effect is quite invisible

AB  - Decentralized distributed systems such as peer-to-peer systems are particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks, where a malicious user pretends to have multiple identities (called sybil nodes). Without a trusted central authority, defending against sybil attacks is quite challenging. Among the small number of decentralized approaches, our recent SybilGuard protocol [H. Yu et al., 2006] leverages a key insight on social networks to bound the number of sybil nodes accepted. Although its direction is promising, SybilGuard can allow a large number of sybil nodes to be accepted. Furthermore, SybilGuard assumes that social networks are fast mixing, which has never been confirmed in the real world. This paper presents the novel SybilLimit protocol that leverages the same insight as SybilGuard but offers dramatically improved and near-optimal guarantees. The number of sybil nodes accepted is reduced by a factor of ominus(radicn), or around 200 times in our experiments for a million-node system. We further prove that SybilLimit's guarantee is at most a log n factor away from optimal, when considering approaches based on fast-mixing social networks. Finally, based on three large-scale real-world social networks, we provide the first evidence that real-world social networks are indeed fast mixing. This validates the fundamental assumption behind SybilLimit's and SybilGuard's approach.

AB  - Anomaly detection is a key element of intrusion detection and other detection systems in which perturbations of normal behavior suggest the presence of intentionally or unintentionally induced attacks, faults, defects, etc. Because most anomaly detectors are based on probabilistic algorithms that exploit the intrinsic structure (or regularity) embedded in data logs, a fundamental question is whether or not such structure influences detection performance. If detector performance is indeed a function of environmental regularity, it would be critical to match detectors to environmental characteristics. In intrusion-detection settings, however, this is not done, possibly because such characteristics are not easily ascertained. This paper introduces a metric for characterizing structure in data environments, and tests the hypothesis that intrinsic structure influences probabilistic detection. In a series of experiments, an anomaly detection algorithm was applied to a benchmark suite of 165 carefully calibrated, anomaly-injected data sets of varying structure. The results showed performance differences of as much as an order of magnitude, indicating that current approaches to anomaly detection may not be universally dependable

AB  - A wrapper has been developed that monitors the runtime behavior of opened email attachments to ensure that these processes do not do anything harmful. The wrapper detects violations of process-specific rules establishing the acceptable (and safe) behavior of these processes relative to four resources: the file system, the system registry, inter-host communication, and process spawning. The wrapper can determine whether an operation is being performed by the native application or by active content within the email attachment and applies a different (and presumably more stringent) set of rules to the latter. When attempted violations are detected, the user is notified and informed of the severity of the violation. The user determines whether to allow or prohibit the offending operation. The violation, the user's response, and the initiating email and attachment-obtained from the email client-are logged

AB  - In this paper, a novel architecture for a streaming intrusion detection system for Grid computing environments is presented. Detection mechanisms based on traditional log-files or single host databases are replaced by a streaming database approach. The streaming architecture allows processing of temporal attack data across multiple sites and offers the potential for performance benefits in large scale systems, since data is processed during its natural flow and only stored as long as necessary for analysis. Two cross-site example attacks in a Grid environment and the streaming detection logic for these attacks are presented to illustrate the approach. Experimental results of a prototypical implementation are presented.

AB  - A digital chain of custody is an account documenting digital data at a particular place and time. This paper gives a method of validating and authenticating a digital chain of custody using an algorithm by Jakobsson and by providing a new algorithm that compliments Jakobsson's algorithm. Our method assumes specialized hardware. The physical hardware is assumed to be memory and processor constrained. Our new algorithm is an online algorithm that generates a hash chain of n hash elements without knowledge of n before it starts. At the same time, as n grows our new algorithm stores only the [log n] pebbles which are inputs for Jakobsson's amortized hash chain traversal algorithm. Jakobsson's algorithm is then used to validate hash elements and thus the digital chain of custody. The complimentary algorithm presented here is used to generate and store the hash chain. The compact representation used by these algorithms is useful to store a large digital chain of custody on a small and constrained device. Our proposed method allows the use of constrained devices to validate complex and ephemeral data such as shipping manifests and handling logs.

AB  - Evidence of malicious insider activity is often buried within large data streams, such as system logs accumulated over months or years. Ensemble-based stream mining leverages multiple classification models to achieve highly accurate anomaly detection in such streams even when the stream is unbounded, evolving, and unlabeled. This makes the approach effective for identifying insider threats who attempt to conceal their activities by varying their behaviors over time. This paper applies ensemble-based stream mining, unsupervised learning, and graph-based anomaly detection to the problem of insider threat detection, demonstrating that the ensemble-based approach is significantly more effective than traditional single-model methods.

AB  - After an attack on a database system, evaluation of damage must be performed as soon the attack is identified. Otherwise, the initial damage would spread to other parts of the database via valid transactions, consequently resulting in denial-of-service. Damage assessment in a distributed database system is a complicated task due to intricate transaction relationships among distributed sites. In these systems, when any sub-transaction reads a damaged data at any site, the entire transaction of which the sub-transaction is a part, is considered affected by the damage. Hence, the data items updated by that transaction irrespective of sites are also considered damaged. This research focuses on damage assessment procedure for distributed database systems and uses a two-pass algorithm to obtain the final list of affected data items. The advantages of this method are: (1) the process is fully distributed in the sense that every site would execute the same algorithm, (2) the amount of data to be exchanged between the sites is minimized to the list of affected items at each site instead of the entire log, and (3) the local damage assessors can be executed in parallel at their respective sites

AB  - We propose a semi supervised classifier for intrusion detection. In our approach, we classify the data entering the computer network. To achieve this, we start with two broad classes of data namely, malicious data and good data. We use Support vector machine based classifier with spherical decision boundaries to classify a chosen subset of malicious data taken as training samples. In the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) database, all data identified as malicious data according to our classifier is included as signature (of attack). Using our classifier for testing the out-of-sample data samples, we observe that the accuracy of the system is 72% for web log data.

AB  - Peer to peer (P2P) systems are extremely vulnerable to Sybil attacks, in which a malicious user controls a large number of Sybil peers to collude to break the system laws. This paper proposes a distributed algorithm, named Sybil Resisting Network Clustering (SRNC), to resist the Sybil attack by preventing honest peers from communicating with Sybil Peers. SRNC is based on a social network model. In this model, honest peers and Sybil peers can be largely classified into two clusters, connected by a small number of edges, called attack edges. SRNC tries to explicitly detect attack edges, and then prohibits the communication over the detected edges. The performance of SRNC is evaluated by theoretical analysis and simulations. In particular, SRNC ensures theoretically that honest peers totally accept O(|AE|) Sybil peers. This is a O(log(n)) times improvement over SybilLimit, one of the conventional representative Sybil resisting algorithms, where n is the number of peers and |AE| is the number of attack edges in the system. The performance is then evaluated by simulations on data sets of real world social networks.

AB  - Polar coding theorems state that as the number of channel use, n, tends to infinity, the fraction of un-polarized bit-channels (the bit-channels whose Z parameters are in the interval (&#x03B4;(n), 1- &#x03B4; (n)), tends to zero. Consider two BEC channels W(z<sub>1</sub>) and W(z<sub>2</sub>). Motivated by polar coding scheme proposed for the wiretap channel, we investigate the number of bit-channels which are simultaneously un-polarized for both of W(z<sub>1</sub>) and W(z<sub>2</sub>). We show that for finite values of n, there is a considerable regime of (z<sub>1</sub>, Z<sub>2</sub>) where the set of (joint)un-polarized bit-channels is empty. We also show that for &#x03B3; &#x2264; 1/2 and &#x03B4; (n) = 2<sup>-n&#x03B3;</sup>, the number of un-polarized bit-channels is lower bounded by 2&#x03B3; log (n).

AB  - Honeynets are an increasingly popular choice deployed by organizations to lure attackers into a trap network, for collection and analysis of unauthorized network activity. A Honeynet captures substantial amount of data and logs for analysis in order to identify malicious activities perpetrated by the hacker community. The analysis of this large amount of data is a challenging task. Through this paper, we propose a technique based on the entropy and volume thresholds of selected network features to efficiently analyze Honeynet data, and identify malicious activities. Our technique consists of both feature-based and volume-based schemes to identify malicious activities in the Honeynet traffic. Through deployment of our proposed approach, a detailed analysis of various traffic features is conducted and the most appropriate features for Honeynet traffic are thereupon selected. The anomalies are identified using entropy distributions and volume distributions, along with their corresponding threshold levels. The proposed scheme proves to be effective in identifying most types of anomalies seen in Honeynet traffic.

AB  - Traditional damage assessment approaches can only locate damage caused by reading corrupted data in a post-intrusion database. This paper indicates another kind of damage spreading pattern characterized by omitting maliciously deleted data, which was not considered in previous studies. An extended recovery model arms at this problem is presented and a novel approach based on the model is proposed to recover a damaged database from malicious attacks. This approach can track the damage spreading more completely by maintaining before image tables (BI tables) in databases and analyzing transactions' potential-read to the BI tables. BI tables are also used for damage repair without accessing database logs. Experimental evaluation of the overhead of this method based upon TPC-C benchmark is also presented.

AB  - E-mail traffic analysis is an area of work that focuses on extracting information about the behaviour of e-mail users based on the sender, receiver, and date/time information taken from the header section of e-mail messages. Such work has applications for law enforcement where investigators and analysts require techniques to assist them with finding unusual or suspicious patterns from large amounts of communication log data. This paper describes work using hierarchical fuzzy systems to detect abnormal changes in e-mail traffic behaviour, through the fusion of e-mail traffic behaviour measurements. The paper focuses on the use of three different hierarchical fuzzy system architectures, to determine the effect that input variable groupings have on the abnormality ratings given to the communication links of suspect e-mail accounts. The case study demonstrates the use of the three hierarchical fuzzy system architectures for analysing suspect e-mail accounts belonging to the Enron e-mail corpus.

AB  - A widely used defense practice against malicious traffic on the Internet is through blacklists: lists of prolific attack sources are compiled and shared. The goal of blacklists is to predict and block future attack sources. Existing blacklisting techniques have focused on the most prolific attack sources and, more recently, on collaborative blacklisting. In this paper, we formulate the problem of forecasting attack sources (also referred to as "predictive blacklisting") based on shared attack logs, as an implicit recommendation system. We compare the performance of existing approaches against the upper bound for prediction and we demonstrate that there is much room for improvement. Inspired by the recent NetFlix competition, we propose a multi-level collaborative filtering model that is adjusted and tuned specifically for the attack forecasting problem. Our model captures and combines various factors namely: attacker-victim history (using time-series) and attackers and/or victims interactions (using neighborhood models). We evaluate our combined method on one month of logs from Dshield.org and demonstrate that it improves significantly the prediction rate over state-of-the-art methods as well as the robustness against poisoning attacks.

AB  - The multi-step attack is one of the primary forms of the current network intrusions. How to detect these attacks is an important aspect of IDS (Intrusion Detection System) research. The correlation research in intrusion detection performs mainly on the following aspects: reducing the false alert rate and omission rate; detecting unknown attacks; attack forecasting. Especially the development of the third point perhaps improves the passive detection to the active protection. Through the study on patterns of the multi-step attack, a model of alert correlation which is based on self-regulate is designed. This paper describes the definition and classification of alert correlation. Also it introduces the association rules. To improve efficiency of IDS, the paper applies data mining technology to IDS In the paper we present a method of how to acquire the intrusion knowledge from the logs and detect the intrusion behaviors based on the improved Apriori algorithm.

AB  - Due to customers' demands, network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are required more real time. Since traditional intelligent NIDS are constructed on the basis of historical network data and system logs, they are expensive and not real time in a network stream environment. This paper presents an improved real time model that based on sequence mining to accelerate the accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, multidimensional item set is used to describes network events, sliding window is used to gather network data stream, and sequence mining algorithms are applied to discover intrusions from normal network stream. Analysis and study on this model indicate that it provide a more accurate and efficient way to building real-time NIDS.

AB  - The focus of intrusion detection has recently shifted from user-based and connection-based to process-based intrusion detection. Substantial research has been done in the analysis of system call logs using different methods including neural networks. Detection is based on the classification of short sequences as anomalous or normal. The classification of interest, however, is the status of the program trace, not just the short sequences. In this paper we report the results of a comparative study of three different methods for on-line classification of program traces based detection of anomalies in sequences of system calls by neural networks. These results demonstrate that methods that use information about the locality of anomalies are more effective than those that only look at the number of anomalies.

AB  - Transaction Dependency is the base of the self-healing database system to do the selective recovery after malicious attacks. According to the dependency of transactions, self-healing database system needs undo only suspect transactions in the transaction log in order to reduce the impact of suspect transactions as much as possible. By analyzing the existing mechanism of logging, this paper presents a new transaction dependency mechanism which contains inter-transaction reverse-dependency log, tracing the reverse dependency of all the transactions, and transaction operation log, recording image dates of each transaction to rollback. The algorithm of UTS (Undo Transaction Set) is also presented. At last, we analyzed the performance and space overhead of this method compared with other methods.

AB  - Existing host-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) use the operating system log or the application log to detect misuse or anomaly activities. These methods are not sufficient for detecting intrusion in database systems. In this paper, we describe a method for database intrusion detection by using data dependency relationships. Typically before a data item is updated in the database some other data items are read or written. And after the update other data items may also be written. These data items read or written in the course of updating one data item construct the read set, pre-write set, and the post-write set for this data item. The proposed method identifies malicious transactions by comparing these sets with data items read or written in user transactions. We have provided mechanisms for finding data dependency relationships among transactions and use Petri nets to model normal data update patterns at user task level. Using this method we ascertain more hidden anomalies in the database log.

AB  - In this paper we show a small but fast popularity-based front-end cache can provide provable DDOS prevention for randomly partitioned cluster services with replication. To achieve this, we first give the best strategy for an adversary to overload the system, and then prove that the cache size is lower bounded by O(n log log n/ log d), where n is the number of back-end nodes and d is the replication factor. Since log log n/ log d &lt;; 2 holds for almost all the current clusters (i.e., the number of back-end nodes n &lt;; 10<sup>5</sup> and the replication factor d &#x2265; 3), this result implies an O(n) lower bound on the required cache size. Our analysis and results are well validated through extensive simulations.

AB  - Finding unusual (anomalous) events in a network is a crucial task for network operation. The collection and analysis of the log messages from the network devices (i.e., router and switch) are a common method. However, the detection of the anomalous events is painful because of a huge amount and many types of log messages; the important event messages are sometimes hidden in a large number of relatively less important and usual event messages. Many researches have been devoted to find out anomalies accurately and quickly by using time series of log message. To construct the log time series for anomaly detection in order to highlight such hidden anomalies, this paper focuses on the effectiveness of using a global weight that is based on a global appearance of a message type in the all data set. We introduce two types of the global weight called residual inverse document frequency (RIDF) and entropy that are well-known method in information retrieval field. Then, we evaluate the performance improvement due to the global weights with a wavelet-based abrupt change detection algorithm through 1-year long collection of core router log messages taken from a Japanese R&amp;E network. Our main findings are (1) the global weights assign a low weight to less important and frequently appeared event messages, (2) they highlight unusual events by removing temporal correlation (i.e., periodic trend), and (3) the wavelet-based detection algorithm more accurately alarms the anomalous time period with the weighted time series.

AB  - The Domain Name System (DNS) is an essential part of the Internet infrastructure and provides fundamental services, such as translating host names into IP addresses for Internet communication. The DNS is vulnerable to a number of potential faults and attacks. In particular, false routing announcements can deny access to the DNS service or redirect DNS queries to a malicious impostor. Due to the hierarchical DNS design, a single fault or attack against the routes to any of the top-level DNS servers can disrupt Internet services to millions of users. We propose a path-filtering approach to protect the routes to the critical top-level DNS servers. Our approach exploits both the high degree of redundancy in top-level DNS servers and the observation that popular destinations, including top-level DNS servers, are well-connected via stable routes. Our path-filter restricts the potential top-level DNS server route changes to be within a set of established paths. Heuristics derived from routing operations are used to adjust the potential routes over time. We tested our path-filtering design against BGP routing logs and the results show that the design can effectively ensure correct routes to top-level DNS servers without impacting DNS service availability.

AB  - In order to create a safe and harmonious cyberspace environment for youth and protect them from the impact of bad information such as pornography, violence and gambling, most of the current solutions are to shield the sites containing this information. However some youth will take the initiative to seek out this bad information. In this paper we propose a method to analyze the searching behavior of youth and then to shield those keywords that may impact their health over time. We suggest that search engine operators provide keywords filtering technology to limit the searching behavior of youth. Operators should return to warning users who search keywords that contain bad information and record the searching log as feedback to parents. Of course parents should provide their IP addresses to the search engine operators first, to allow operators to set their IP addresses within the scope of supervising. Relying on search logs we count and classify keywords to understand the trend of youths' searching behavior and the areas that they often are interested in. Then we cluster the keywords in each area to get some main clusters and frequent keywords. Using this method we can grasp youths' searching behavior and protect them from the impact of bad information effectively.

AB  - In this paper we consider the problem of searching for an intruder in a network. There is a team of collaborative software agents that are deployed to capture a hostile intruder (e.g., a virus). These agents asynchronously move along the network links and the intruder has the capability of escaping arbitrarily fast. We propose two different strategies for the solution of the problem in a widely studied topology: the hypercube network. In the first strategy one of the agents acts as a coordinator making the other agents move in a precise way; this strategy requires O(n log n) moves, a team of O(frac{n}{{nlog n}}) agents and runs in O(n log n) time steps. The second strategy is devised for a model where the agents are allowed to "see" the state of their neighbours. In this case, the computation is local, i.e., there is no need of a coordinator and agents can move automously. In this setting the solution requires frac{n}{2} agents, but is much faster (log n time steps), and requires the same number of moves (O(n log n)).

AB  - Protecting user privacy in network communication is vital in todaypsilas open networking environment. Current anonymous routing protocols provide anonymity by forwarding traffic through a static path of randomly selected relay nodes. In practice, however, malicious relays can perform passive logging attacks to compromise the anonymity of a flow. This degradation is accelerated when nodes fail, forcing source node to reconstruct a path, and in doing so, leaking more information to passive loggers. This ldquopredecessor attackrdquo is highly effective and difficult to defend against on current systems. In this paper, we propose a highly effective approach to blocking predecessor attacks by leveraging trusted links from social networks. We first show how users can completely shield themselves from traditional logging attacks. We then propose a hybrid logging attack optimized for social networks, and perform detailed analysis to show that we can defend against it using optimized path selection techniques. Finally, we analyze detailed measurement traces from Facebook to show that our approach is indeed feasible given the user behavior in social networks today.

AB  - In this paper, we study the straggler identification problem, in which an algorithm must determine the identities of the remaining members of a set after it has had a large number of insertion and deletion operations performed on it, and now has relatively few remaining members. The goal is to do this in o(n) space, where n is the total number of identities. Straggler identification has applications, for example, in determining the unacknowledged packets in a high-bandwidth multicast data stream. We provide a deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem that uses only O(d log n) bits, based on a novel application of Newton's identities for symmetric polynomials. This solution can identify any subset of d stragglers from a set of n O(log n)-bit identifiers, assuming that there are no false deletions of identities not already in the set. Indeed, we give a lower bound argument that shows that any small-space deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem cannot be guaranteed to handle false deletions. Nevertheless, we provide a simple randomized solution, using O(d log n log (1/&#x2208;)) bits that can maintain a multiset and solve the straggler identification problem, tolerating false deletions, where &#x2208; &gt; 0 is a user-defined parameter bounding the probability of an incorrect response. This randomized solution is based on a new type of Bloom filter, which we call the invertible Bloom filter.

AB  - Collaborative information systems (CIS) enable users to coordinate efficiently over shared tasks. They are often deployed in complex dynamic systems that provide users with broad access privileges, but also leave the system vulnerable to various attacks. Techniques to detect threats originating from beyond the system are relatively mature, but methods to detect insider threats are still evolving. A promising class of insider threat detection models for CIS focus on the communities that manifest between users based on the usage of common subjects in the system. However, current methods detect only when a user's aggregate behavior is intruding, not when specific actions have deviated from expectation. In this paper, we introduce a method called specialized network anomaly detection (SNAD) to detect such events. SNAD assembles the community of users that access a particular subject and assesses if similarities of the community with and without a certain user are sufficiently different. We present a theoretical basis and perform an extensive empirical evaluation with the access logs of two distinct environments: those of a large electronic health record system (6,015 users, 130,457 patients and 1,327,500 accesses) and the editing logs of Wikipedia (2,388,955 revisors, 55,200 articles and 6,482,780 revisions). We compare SNAD with several competing methods and demonstrate it is significantly more effective: on average it achieves 20-30% greater area under an ROC curve.

AB  - Fair exchange between two or more potentially mutually distrusted parties has been identified as an important issue in electronic commerce. However, the correctness (fairness) of the existing fair exchange protocols that use a trusted third party (TTP) is based on the assumption that, during an exchange, there are no failures at any of the local systems involved in the exchange, which is too strong in many situations. This paper points out that (1) system failures could cause loss of fairness, and (2) existing fair exchange protocols that use TTPs cannot ensure fairness in presence of system failures. We present a systematic way to develop such data exchange systems that can recover from system failures without losing fairness. We identify a set of fairness loss risks caused by local system failures. We identify a fault-tolerance correctness criterion for fair data exchange, denoted &ldquo;fairness-lossless recoverability&rdquo;. A fairness-lossless recoverable fair exchange system is immune from the set of fairness loss risks. Standard message logging approaches are then studied and extended to achieve fairness-lossless recoverability with good performance

AB  - Effective mitigation of denial of service (DoS) attack is a pressing problem on the Internet. In many instances, DoS attacks can be prevented if the spoofed source IP address is traced back to its origin which allows assigning penalties to the offending party or isolating the compromised hosts and domains from the rest of the network. IP traceback mechanisms based on probabilistic packet marking (PPM) have been proposed for achieving traceback of DoS attacks. We show that probabilistic packet marking-of interest due to its efficiency and implementability vis-a-vis deterministic packet marking and logging or messaging based schemes-suffers under spoofing of the marking field in the IP header by the attacker which can impede traceback by the victim. We show that there is a trade-off between the ability of the victim to localize the attacker and the severity of the DoS attack, which is represented as a function of the marking probability, path length, and traffic volume. The optimal decision problem-the victim can choose the marking probability whereas the attacker can choose the spoofed marking value, source address, and attack volume-can be expressed as a constrained minimax optimization problem, where the victim chooses the marking probability such that the number of forgeable attack paths is minimized. We show that the attacker's ability to hide his location is curtailed by increasing the marking probability, however, the latter is upper-bounded due to sampling constraints. In typical IP internets, the attacker's address can be localized to within 2-5 equally likely sites which renders PPM effective against single source attacks. Under distributed DoS attacks, the uncertainty achievable by the attacker can be amplified, which diminishes the effectiveness of PPM

AB  - In (distributed) denial of service attack ((D)DoS), attackers send a huge number of packets with spoofed source addresses to disguise themselves toward a target host or network Various IP traceback techniques such as link testing, marking, and logging to find out the real source of attacking packets have been proposed. We present a marking scheme (with marking and traceback algorithms) in which a router marks a packet with a link that the packet came through. Links of a router are represented by Huffman codes according to the traffic distribution among the links. If the packet runs out of space allotted for the marking field in the packet header, then the router stores the marking field in the router's local memory along with a message digest of the packet. We analyze the memory requirement of routers to store marking fields, compare the scheme with other existing techniques, and address practical issues to deploy the scheme in the Internet. The scheme marks every packet, therefore IP traceback can be accomplished with only a packet unlike in probabilistic markings; also it requires far less amount of memory compared to logging methods and is robust in case of DDoS.

This system collects data from application layer and network layer and classifies them using the log file data collected from these layers and local anomalies are computed using local agents finally it is sent to a global agent for integration. The local agents monitor the two layers of the network to determine the correlation among the observed anomalous patterns, reporting such abnormal behavior to the administrator for taking possible action. Our simulation results obtained after integration shows that it is possible to obtain high intrusion-detection rates (99.2%) and low false-alarm rates

AB  - Many electronic watermarks for still images and video content are sensitive to geometric distortions. For example, simple rotation, scaling, and/or translation (RST) of an image can prevent blind detection of a public watermark. In this paper, we propose a watermarking algorithm that is robust to RST distortions. The watermark is embedded into a one-dimensional (1-D) signal obtained by taking the Fourier transform of the image, resampling the Fourier magnitudes into log-polar coordinates, and then summing a function of those magnitudes along the log-radius axis. Rotation of the image results in a cyclical shift of the extracted signal. Scaling of the image results in amplification of the extracted signal, and translation of the image has no effect on the extracted signal. We can therefore compensate for rotation with a simple search, and compensate for scaling by using the correlation coefficient as the detection measure. False positive results on a database of 10 000 images are reported. Robustness results on a database of 2000 images are described. It is shown that the watermark is robust to rotation, scale, and translation. In addition, we describe tests examining the watermarks resistance to cropping and JPEG compression

AB  - Anomaly detection based on monitoring of sequences of system calls has been shown to be an effective method for detection of previously unseen, potentially damaging attacks on hosts. This paper presents a new model for profiling normal program behavior for use in detection of intrusions that change application execution flow. This model is compact and efficient to operate and can be acquired using a combination of static analysis and dynamic learning. Our model (hybrid push down automata, HPDA) incorporates call stack information in the automata model and effectively captures the control flow of a program. Several important properties of the model are based on a unique correspondence relation between addresses and instructions within the model. These properties allow the HPDA to be acquired by dynamic analysis of an audit of the call stack log. Our strategy is to use static analysis to acquire a base model and then to use dynamic learning as a supplement to capture those aspects of behavior that are difficult to capture with static analysis due to techniques commonly used in modern programming environments. The model created by this combination method is shown to have a higher detection capability than models acquired by static analysis alone and a lower false positive rate than models acquired by dynamic learning alone.

AB  - Increasing workload on multi-user database management system (DBMS) can cause maximum system's throughput. With further increase of workload, throughput dramatically decreases and system performance fall down; then system starts to thrash. Existence of an admission control component for managing user's requests is necessary. Admission control component in DBMS has two main tasks. These tasks are Prevention of increasing user's communication requests to system more than a threshold and prevention, deferment or execution of received requests after optimization step and determination of request requirements. The problem is determination of allowable number of communications to DBMS. Can we predict and determine conditions to providence time and resource before reach to optimization step? In this paper we use data mining techniques to predict and describe admission control policies. According to this purpose we recommend an Admission Logging system to log existing actions before end of query processor procedures. We describe situation, structure, and changes that we need in system. Then we describe the circumstance of knowledge extraction on Admission Log.

AB  - Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed over the Internet on an as-needed basis. A major feature of the cloud services is that users' data are usually processed remotely in unknown machines that users do not own or operate. While enjoying the convenience brought by this new emerging technology, users' fears of losing control of their own data (particularly, financial and health data) can become a significant barrier to the wide adoption of cloud services. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel highly decentralized information accountability framework to keep track of the actual usage of the users' data in the cloud. In particular, we propose an object-centered approach that enables enclosing our logging mechanism together with users' data and policies. We leverage the JAR programmable capabilities to both create a dynamic and traveling object, and to ensure that any access to users' data will trigger authentication and automated logging local to the JARs. To strengthen user's control, we also provide distributed auditing mechanisms. We provide extensive experimental studies that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

AB  - Many types of brute-force attacks are known to exhibit a characteristic `flat' behavior at the network-level, meaning that connections belonging to an attack feature a similar number of packets and bytes, and duration. Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.

AB  - Many network phenomena are well modeled as spreads of epidemics through a network. Prominent examples include the spread of worms and email viruses, and, more generally, faults. Many types of information dissemination can also be modeled as spreads of epidemics. In this paper we address the question of what makes an epidemic either weak or potent. More precisely, we identify topological properties of the graph that determine the persistence of epidemics. In particular, we show that if the ratio of cure to infection rates is larger than the spectral radius of the graph, then the mean epidemic lifetime is of order log n, where n is the number of nodes. Conversely, if this ratio is smaller than a generalization of the isoperimetric constant of the graph, then the mean epidemic lifetime is of order e<sup>na</sup>, for a positive constant a. We apply these results to several network topologies including the hypercube, which is a representative connectivity graph for a distributed hash table, the complete graph, which is an important connectivity graph for BGP, and the power law graph, of which the AS-level Internet graph is a prime example. We also study the star topology and the Erdos-Renyi graph as their epidemic spreading behaviors determine the spreading behavior of power law graphs.

AB  - With widely adoption of online services, malicious web sites have become a malignant tumor of the Internet. Through system vulnerabilities, attackers can upload malicious files (which are also called webshells) to web server to create a backdoor for hackers' further attacks. Therefore, finding and detecting webshell inside web application source code are crucial to secure websites. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the optimal threshold values to identify files that contain malicious codes from web applications. Our detection system will scan and look for malicious codes inside each file of the web application, and automatically give a list of suspicious files and a detail log analysis table of each suspicious file for administrators to check further. The Experimental results show that our approach is applicable to identify webshell more efficient than some other approaches.

AB  - We present collaborative peer-to-peer algorithms for the problem of approximating frequency counts for popular items distributed across the peers of a large-scale network. Our algorithms are attack-resistant in the sense that they function correctly even in the case where an adaptive and computationally unbounded adversary causes up to a 1/3 fraction of the peers in the network to suffer Byzantine faults. Our algorithms are scalable in the sense that all resource costs are polylogarithmic. Specifically, latency is O(log n); the number of messages and number of bits sent and received by each peer is O(log<sup>2</sup>n) per item; and number of neighbors of each peer is O(log<sup>2</sup>n). Our motivation for addressing this problem is to provide a tool for the following three applications: worm and virus detection; spam detection; and distributed data-mining. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithms are the first attack-resistant and scalable algorithms for this problem. Moreover, surprisingly, our algorithms seem to be the first attack-resistant algorithms for any data mining problem.

AB  - Golomb analyzed the Z-channel, a memoryless channel with two input symbols and two output symbols, where one of the input symbols is transmitted with noise while the other is transmitted without noise, and the output symbol transmission times are equal. We generalize to the timed Z-channel, where the output symbol transmission times are not equal. The timed Z-channel appears as the basis for a large class of covert (communication) channels appearing in multilevel secure computer systems. We give a detailed mathematical analysis of the timed Z-channel and report a result expressing the capacity of the timed Z-channel as the log of the root of a characteristic equation. This generalizes Shannon's work on noiseless channels for this special case. We also report a new result bounding the timed Z-channel's capacity from below. We show how an interesting observation that Golomb reported for the Z-channel also holds for the timed Z-channel

AB  - We consider the problem of stabilizing a plant with a network of resource constrained wireless nodes. In a companion paper, we developed a protocol where each node repeatedly transmits an appropriate (stabilizing) linear combination of the values in its neighborhood. In this paper, we design an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for this control scheme, which observes the transmissions of certain nodes and uses that information to (a) recover the plant outputs (for data-logging and diagnostic purposes) and (b) identify malicious behavior by any of the wireless nodes in the network. We show that if the connectivity of the network is sufficiently high, the IDS only needs to observe a subset of the nodes in the network in order to achieve this objective. Our approach provides a characterization of the set of nodes that should be observed, a systematic procedure for the IDS to use to identify the malicious nodes and recover the outputs of the plant, and an upper bound on the delay required to obtain the necessary information.

AB  - A frequent assumption in the domain of cybersecurity is that cyberintrusions follow the properties of a Poisson process, i.e., that the number of intrusions is well modeled by a Poisson distribution and that the time between intrusions is exponentially distributed. This paper studies this property by analyzing all cyberintrusions that have been detected across more than 260,000 computer systems over a period of almost three years. The results show that the assumption of a Poisson process model might be unoptimal - the log-normal distribution is a significantly better fit in terms of modeling both the number of detected intrusions and the time between intrusions, and the Pareto distribution is a significantly better fit in terms of modeling the time to first intrusion. The paper also analyzes whether time to compromise (TTC) increase for each successful intrusion of a computer system. The results regarding this property suggest that time to compromise decrease along the number of intrusions of a system.

AB  - Web access logs contain information which can be converted to represent the access history of individual users. A large number of essential attributes can be extracted from the access history. For example, the access counts of each webpage, the occurrence of different webpage access sequences and the time spent between consecutive accesses. Each of the above attributes represents a dimension in the feature space, and all the attributes together form a very high dimension space. Diffusion Wavelets can efficiently project the high dimensional data onto a low-dimensional space according to the correlations between various attributes, so that common anomaly detection algorithms can be applied. In this paper, we propose a system which leverages this technique to differentiate web-access requests generated by Denial of Service (DoS) attacks from legitimate ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system via simulation studies using real-world web access logs. For a simulated HTTP flooding attack which creates a 1000% overload at the web-server, the proposed scheme can reduce the ratio of the attack-to-legitimate requests admitted by the server from 200:1 to 30:1 so that more than 55% of the legitimate requests can still receive proper services under such a severe DoS attack.

AB  - Since Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) operate in real-time, they should be light-weighted to detect intrusions as fast as possible. Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.

Golomb (1980) analyzed the Z-channel, a memoryless channel with two input symbols and two output symbols, where one of the input symbols is transmitted with noise while the other is transmitted without noise, and the output symbol transmission times are equal. We introduce the timed Z-channel, where the output symbol transmission times are different. Specifically, we show how the timed Z-channel applies to two examples of covert timing channel scenarios: a CPU scheduler and a token ring network. We then give a detailed analysis of our timed Z-channel. We report a new result expressing the capacity of the timed Z-channel as the log of the root of a trinomial equation. This changes the capacity calculation from an optimization problem into a simpler algebraic problem and illustrates the relationship between the noise and time factors. Further, it generalizes Shannon's (1948, 1949) work on noiseless channels for this special case. We also report a new result bounding the timed Z-channel's capacity from below. Finally, we show how an interesting observation that Golomb reported for the Z-channel also holds for the timed Z-channel

AB  - Intrusion Detection Systems are fast-growing techniques for monitoring and garnering electronic evidences about suspicious activities that signify threats to computer systems. Generally, these mechanisms overwhelmingly describe and record patterns of suspicious packets as alerts in the form of intrusion logs. Thereafter, analysts must subsequently validate the content of each intrusion log to ascertain the validity of each alert. Secondly, high level of expertise is required to discern each alert. However, more time and resources are unduly spent at the expense of countermeasures that ought to be proactively initiated to thwart attacks in progress. Accordingly, TSA-Log analyzer that uses a computationally fast technique and a uniform baseline to determine patterns of intrusions is proposed in this paper. Validations that are carried out on five publicly available datasets demonstrate that propagation strategies of intrusions, efficient countermeasures and the extent of similarity of intrusions can be forecasted giving the knowledge of the patterns of alerts in intrusion logs.

AB  - In this paper we propose an intrusion prevention system (IPS) which operates inline and is capable to detect unknown attacks using anomaly detection methods. Incorporated in the framework of a packet filter each incoming packet is analyzed and -- according to an internal connection state and a computed anomaly score -- either delivered to the production system, redirected to a special hardened system or logged to a network sink for later analysis. Runtime measurements of an actual implementation prove that the performance overhead of the system is sufficient for inline processing. Accuracy measurements on real network data yield improvements especially in the number of false positives, which are reduced by a factor of five compared to a plain anomaly detector.

AB  - False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) happen to every Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). No one could do better judgment than others all the time. This work proposes a system of Attack Session Extraction (ASE) to create a pool of suspicious traffic traces which cause potential FNs (abbreviated as P-FNs) and potential FPs (abbreviated as P-FPs) to IPSes. Developers of IPSes can use these suspicious traffic traces to improve the accuracy of their products. Traffic traces are called suspicious since what they cause are P-FNs and P-FPs which need to be confirmed by the developers of IPSes whether P-FNs are FNs and P-FPs are FPs. First, the ASE captures real traffic and replays captured traffic traces to multiple IPSes. By comparing the logs of IPSes, we can find that some attack logs are logged or not logged only at certain IPS. The former is P-FPs, while the latter is P-FNs to that IPS. The ASE then starts to extract this suspicious traffic from replayed traffic traces. The extracted traffic traces can then be used for further analysis by IPS developers. Some of the traces may prove to be guilty, i.e. confirmed to be FNs and FPs. To completely extract a suspicious session, the ASE uses an association mechanism based on anchor packets, five-tuple and time, and similarity for the first packet, first connection, and whole session, respectively. It calculates the degree of similarity among packets to extract a suspicious session containing multiple connections. We define variation and completeness/purity as the performance indexes to evaluate ASE. The experiments demonstrate that 95% of extracted sessions have low variation, and the average completeness/purity is around 80%.

Such attacks can be detected by analyzing Log File of server. In this paper, attempt has been made to present a model by combining web mining technique with fuzzy logic approach to evaluate probability of DOS attacks using two effective factors of the number of Hits and time interval of the requests so that appropriate preventive measures can be taken under different conditions.

AB  - Frequent behavioural pattern mining is a very important topic of knowledge discovery, intended to extract correlations between items recorded in large databases or Web access logs. However, those databases are usually considered as a whole and hence, itemsets are extracted over the entire set of records. Our claim is that possible periods, hidden within the structure of the data and containing compact itemsets, may exist. These periods, as well as the itemsets they contain, might not be found by traditional data mining methods due to their very weak support. Furthermore, these periods might be lost depending on an arbitrary division of the data. The goal of our work is to find itemsets that are frequent over a specific period but would not be extracted by traditional methods since their support is very low over the whole dataset. In this paper, we introduce the definition of solid itemsets, which represent a coherent and compact behavior over a specific period, and we propose SIM, an algorithm for their extraction. This work may find many applications in sensitive domains such as fraud or intrusion detection.

The rotation invariant feature is represented here by the coefficients of 2D Fourier series expansion of the log-polar image. Seal imprint can be verified by the eigen vector corresponding to the largest eigen value of a matrix defined in terms of the above Fourier coefficients. The seal imprint verification experiments are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Traditional data protection technologies, such as remote mirroring, snapshot and backup, cannot completely solve virus attack, user error problems. Continuous data protection (CDP), capturing all data writes at file or block level, is an enabling technology to storage systems against malicious attacks or user mistakes, because it allows each block data to be undoable. Most of existing data protection systems or prototypes are not real CDP ones because there is a data exposure between subsequent snapshots. Therefore they provide less granular recovery points. In addition, some products work either at file system level or at application level which lack general purpose. This paper presents the design, implementation, and performance of a new block level continuous data protection system, TH-CDP. Besides providing the basic functions of true CDP, TH-CDP provides virtual volume image at any point in time without affecting the production system. Another distinctive feature of TH-CDP is its checkpointing mechanism. By encapsulating the checkpoint information into I/O request packet queue, TH-CDP can take checkpoints without temporarily halting normal business processing or any incoming request. In addition, TH-CDP uses log-structured technique to store changed block data on raw disk, thereby speeding up both data writing and space recycling. Extensive experiments on file systems, databases using IOzone, and TPC-C benchmark show that TH-CDP can effectively improve the convenience of checkpointing and recovery assurance process. Under the circumstances of the changed block data up to 20 times of the original data size, the 100% sequence read speed of the oldest virtual volume image version is nearly 1/3 to 1/4 compared to the normal iSCSI volume.

AB  - SPIE, the Source Path Isolation Engine, is a DARPA-funded system for tracing single IP packets back through a network of instrumented routers or tap boxes that are associated with the routers. Historically, tracing individual packets by keeping packet logs at each router has required prohibitive amounts of memory; one of SPIE's key innovations is to reduce the memory requirement (down to 0.5% of link capacity) by storing only packet digests, that is, hashes of the packets rather than the packet itself. SPIE-enhanced routers maintain a cache of packet digests for recently forwarded traffic. If a packet is determined to be offensive by an intrusion detection system (or judged interesting by some other metric), a query is dispatched to the SPIE system that, in turn, queries routers for packet digests of the relevant time periods. ne results of this query are used in a simulated reverse-path flooding algorithm to build a highly reliable and accurate attack graph that identifies the packet's source or sources.

AB  - New versions of existing large-scale web services such as Passport.comcopy have to go through rigorous performance evaluations in order to ensure a high degree of availability. Performance testing (such as benchmarking, scalability, and capacity tests) of large-scale stateful systems in managed test environments has many different challenges, mainly related to the reproducibility of production conditions in live data centers. One of these challenges is creating a dataset in a test environment that mimics the actual dataset in production. Other challenges involve the characterization of load patterns in production based on log analysis and proper load simulation via reutilization of data from the existing dataset. The intent of this paper is to describe practical approaches to address some of the aforementioned challenges through the use of various novel techniques. For example, this paper discusses data sanitization, which is the alteration of large datasets in a controlled manner to obfuscate sensitive information, preserving data integrity, relationships, and data equivalence classes. This paper also provides techniques for load pattern characterization via the application of Markov chains to custom and generic logs, as well as general guidelines for the development of cache-based load simulation tools tailored for the performance evaluation of stateful systems.

AB  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) deploy various sensors that collect data, process this data and report events. The process of combining these events or superordinate incidences is known as event correlation. The key issues of this process are (1) to find a way how to combine events based on different data types (e. g. log entries, connection statistics or protocol identifiers), (2) to build a model representing the relations between the events and (3) to apply subsequent analysis that allow us to extract meaningful information from the trained model. In order to address these key issues, we introduce the concept of Activation Patterns. These patterns are generated by applying various techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence to the raw event data. The presented technique is then integrated into an event correlation system. We describe the system and evaluate it by analyzing a popular intrusion detection data set consisting of a wide range of different features.

AB  - Most of trustworthy web service selection simply focus on individual reputation and ignore the collaboration reputation between services. To enhance the collaboration trust during web service selection, a reputation model called collaboration reputation is proposed. The reputation model is built on web service collaboration network(WSCN), which is constructed in terms of the composite service execution log. Thus, the WSCN aims to maintain the trustworthy collaboration alliance among web services, In WSCN, the collaboration reputation can be assessed by two metrics, one called invoking reputation is computed by recommendation, which is selected from the community structure hiding in WSCN, the other is assessed by the invoked web service. In addition, the web service selection based on WSCN is designed.

AB  - The design and implementation of a highly available network file server (HA-NFS) is reported. It is implemented on a network of workstations from the IBM RISC System/6000 family. HA-NFS servers preserve the semantics of the NFS protocol and can be used by existing NFS clients without modification. Therefore, existing application programs can benefit from highly availability without alteration. HA-NFS achieves storage reliability by (optionally) replicating files on different disks. However, all copies of the same file are controlled by a single server, reducing the cost of ensuring consistency. To achieve server reliability, each server is implicitly replicated by a backup that can access the server's disks if the server fails. During normal operation, the backup monitors the liveness of the server but does not maintain information about the server's internal state. Each server maintains a disk log that records state information normally kept in memory

AB  - In order to gain the competitive advantage, more and more hospitals put their attention on determining and optimizing the standard clinical pathway. However, there are many abnormal instances in the event logs which disturb the effect of the process mining and the process analysis. Also, the prescription and the medical test items may have a large difference in the specific disease, where has the similar clinical pathways due to the multi-factor in the clinical pathways. In this paper, an abnormal process instances identification method (APIIM) is proposed. Given the event logs and the standard clinical pathway, the method classifies the instances based on the classification attributes and identifies the abnormal instances by the outlier detection technology. Moreover, a case study using the real data in one hospital is implemented and the result shows that the method is effective and efficient in discovering the abnormal process instances in the healthcare environment.

AB  - Spider is a program for harvesting internet resources. In order to regulate and monitor accessing behavior of spiders, many Spiders Detection Techniques (SDT) are proposed based on Decision Tree and Bayesian Network etc. At present, the evaluation of these detection techniques mainly rely on manual analysis of web log data. In order to objectively and accurately evaluate the detecting capability of SDT, an Evaluation Method based on Trap technique (EMT) is proposed in this paper. The principles of EMT base on the statistical hypothesis that the users captured by trap obeying binomial distribution theory. The traps layout information and users accessing information are used to calculate evaluating indicators. The evaluating result of experiment indicates that EMT has an accurate and scientific conclusion.

AB  - Due to vigorous development of pattern recognition, traditional human form filling tasks would be replaced by automated processes. However, these automation processes are often misused for illegal behavior such as spam e-mail or application for website account. In order to prevent website owner from suffering the attacks of automated program, this paper proposed an innovative image-based CAPTCHA for distinguishing human and computer by embedding versatile characters in the images. The proposed method makes the characters indiscernible by automated image analysis technologies like scale-invariant feature transform while human can easily distinguish the location of the embedded characters. Our designed mechanism was capable to elude such kind of attacks. In experiments, 15 users were invited to test the system and the success rate is 86%. If wrong operations like clicking out of text boxes were excluded, the success rate reached 95%. Compare the average logging time with reCAPTCHA and HELLO CAPTCHA, the proposed method is faster than these two methods by 32 seconds and 115 seconds, respectively.

AB  - Recent research has shown that it is possible to identify malicious URLs through lexical analysis of their URL structures alone. This paper intends to explore the effectiveness of these lightweight classification algorithms when working with large real world datasets including lists of malicious URLs obtained from Phishtank as well as largely filtered benign URLs obtained from proxy traffic logs. Lightweight algorithms are defined as methods by which URLs are analysed that do not use external sources of information such as WHOIS lookups, blacklist lookups and content analysis. These parameters include URL length, number of delimiters as well as the number of traversals through the directory structure and are used throughout much of the research in the paradigm of lightweight classification. Methods which include external sources of information are often called fully featured classifications and have been shown to be only slightly more effective than a purely lexical analysis when considering both false-positives and false-negatives. This distinction allows these algorithms to be run client side without the introduction of additional latency, but still providing a high level of accuracy through the use of modern techniques in training classifiers. Analysis of this type will also be useful in an incident response analysis where large numbers of URLs need to be filtered for potentially malicious URLs as an initial step in information gathering as well as end user implementations such as browser extensions which could help protect the user from following potentially malicious links. Both AROW and CW classifier update methods will be used as prototype implementations and their effectiveness will be compared to fully featured analysis results. These methods are interesting because they are able to train on any labelled data, including instances in which their prediction is correct, allowing them to build a confidence in specific lexical features. This makes it possible fo- - r them to be trained using noisy input data, making them ideal for real world applications such as link filtering and information gathering.

Formulating colluder detection as a binary hypothesis testing problem, we derive the log-likelihood ratio tests for various nonlinear collusion attacks. Utilizing the approximate distribution of the order statistics, we obtain suboptimal detection statistics with low complexity. Compared with the existing correlation-based detectors, these detectors provide substantial improvement in both detection performance and computational complexity.

AB  - In many classification problems such as spam detection and network intrusion, a large number of unlabeled test instances are predicted negative by the classifier However, the high costs as well as time constraints on an expert's time prevent further analysis of the "predicted false" class instances in order to segregate the false negatives from the true negatives. A systematic method is thus required to obtain an estimate of the number of false negatives. A capture-recapture based method can be used to obtain an ML-estimate of false negatives when two or more independent classifiers are available. In the case for which independence does not hold, we can apply log-linear models to obtain an estimate of false negatives. However, as shown in this paper, lesser the dependencies among the classifiers, better is the estimate obtained for false negatives. Thus, ideally independent classifiers should be used to estimate the false negatives in an unlabeled dataset. Experimental results on the spam dataset from the UCI machine learning repository are presented.

AB  - Although conventional database management systems are designed to tolerate hardware and to a lesser extent even software errors, they cannot protect themselves against syntactically correct and semantically damaging transactions, which could arise because of malicious attacks or honest mistakes. The lack of fast post-intrusion or post-error damage repair in modern DBMSs results in a longer mean time to repair (MTTR) and sometimes permanent data loss that could have been saved by more intelligent repair mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of Phoenix - a system that significantly improves the efficiency and precision of a database damage repair process after an intrusion or operator error and thus, increases the overall database system availability. The two key ideas underlying Phoenix are (1) maintaining persistent intertransaction dependency information at run time to allow selective undo of database transactions that are considered "infected" by the intrusion or error in question and (2) exploiting information present in standard database logs for fast selective undo. Performance measurements on a fully operational Phoenix prototype, which is based on the PostgreSQL DBMS, demonstrate that Phoenix incurs a response time and a throughput penalty of less than 5% and 8%, respectively, under the TPC-C benchmark, but it can speed up the post-intrusion database repair process by at least an order of magnitude when compared with a manual repair process.

AB  - Performing predictive modelling, such as anomaly detection, in Big Data is a difficult task. This problem is compounded as more and more sources of Big Data are generated from environmental sensors, logging applications, and the Internet of Things. Further, most current techniques for anomaly detection only consider the content of the data source, i.e. the data itself, without concern for the context of the data. As data becomes more complex it is increasingly important to bias anomaly detection techniques for the context, whether it is spatial, temporal, or semantic. The work proposed in this paper outlines a contextual anomaly detection technique for use in streaming sensor networks. The technique uses a well-defined content anomaly detection algorithm for real-time point anomaly detection. Additionally, we present a post-processing context-aware anomaly detection algorithm based on sensor profiles, which are groups of contextually similar sensors generated by a multivariate clustering algorithm. Our proposed research has been implemented and evaluated with real-world data provided by Powersmiths, located in Brampton, Ontario, Canada.

AB  - Performance upgrades for mobile devices took place due to jumping development of technology, so high-performance terminals that anyone can directly search and amend desired information anywhere and anytime, namely, mobile communication terminals called Smartphone were released to the market. Such terminals can store information that an individual saved, for example, call log, where to make contact and address of acquaintances, transmit/receive message and mail, photographs and videos, etc., but there are worries on surreptitious use of other people due to leaking of personal information through loss or theft of these terminals, so our paper aims to realize a system that remotely controls information inside the terminals in this case. The proposed system consists of four functional units: a website provision unit playing a role of interface so that users can remotely control a terminal, a user confirmation unit that performs joiner confirmation information from a system of a mobile communication company joined after a user confirm oneself as the person oneself, an access management unit that sets access by transmitting an access code for initiating a remote control program if a person is confirmed as a real owner of the terminal, and finally a service execution unit that transmits a remote control service code and an environment setting value for remotely controlling a terminal to the terminal and receives a service completion code from the terminal.

AB  - Accurate recovery from a cyber attack depends on fast and perfect damage assessment. For damage assessment, traditional recovery methods require that the log of an affected database must be scanned starting from the attacking transaction until the end. This is a time-consuming task. Our objective in this research is to provide techniques that can be used to accelerate the damage appraisal process and produce a correct result. We have presented a damage assessment model and four data structures associated with the model. Each of these structures uses dependency relationships among transactions, which update the database. These relationships are later used to determine exactly which transactions and exactly which data items are affected by the attacker. A performance comparison analysis obtained using simulation is provided to demonstrate the benefit of our model

AB  - The nonparametric problem of detecting existence of an anomalous interval over a one-dimensional line network is studied. Nodes corresponding to an anomalous interval (if one exists) receive samples generated by a distribution q, which is different from the distribution p that generates samples for other nodes. If an anomalous interval does not exist, then all nodes receive samples generated by p. It is assumed that the distributions p and q are arbitrary, and are unknown. In order to detect whether an anomalous interval exists, a test is built based on mean embeddings of distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and the metric of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). It is shown that as the network size n goes to infinity, if the minimum length of candidate anomalous intervals is larger than a threshold which has the order O(log n), the proposed test is asymptotically successful. An efficient algorithm to perform the test with substantial computational complexity reduction is proposed, and is shown to be asymptotically successful if the condition on the minimum length of candidate anomalous interval is satisfied. Numerical results are provided, which are consistent with the theoretical results.

AB  - In recent years, the Android operating system for mobile terminals has developed very quickly. A variety of mobile devices which are using Android operating system are more than 60% in the domestic market share. With the number of Android application raising fast, a variety of information leakage, malicious chargeback, failure of operating system events occurred frequently; the safety of Android system also attracts wide attention of researchers. In this paper, combining static analysis and dynamic analysis, we present a malicious code detection method and implementation. Through the statistics of the sensitive API functions and tracking the flow of sensitive information, static analysis module uses the static analysis reverse technology to achieve the detection of malicious behaviors. And dynamic analysis module mainly uses system log analysis and records a variety of sensitive behaviors generated during the operation to discover intrusions. Furthermore, the ultimate combination of static analysis and dynamic analysis will determine whether the target software contains malicious codes.

AB  - This paper presents a learning algorithm for adaptive network intrusion detection based on clustering and nai&#x0308;ve Bayesian classifier, which induces a hybridization of unsupervised and supervised learning processes. The proposed approach scales up the balance detection rates for different types of network intrusions, and keeps the false positives at acceptable level in network intrusion detection. The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result. The performance of the proposed algorithm tested by employing KDD99 benchmark network intrusion detection dataset, and the experimental results proved that it improves the detection rates as well as reduces the false positives for different types of network intrusions.

AB  - Recently many people publicize their blogs and the blogosphere becomes an important information source. It is used for various purposes such as analyzing trends and reputations, marketing, etc. One problem of blogosphere is spam like e-mails and web links. There are many spam blogs (splogs) that are generated to make users to access specific sites. This paper proposes a splog filtering method. Splog is usually generated automatically by copying words and phrases from other documents. Therefore, the proposed method detects strings appearing in multiple blogs and uses a copy rate of strings as a key feature for splog filtering. To evaluate the proposed method, we constructed an evaluation corpus by gathering blogs randomly during a certain period of time and manually judged whether each blog is splog or not. The experiment using this corpus reveals several features of splog filtering by copy string detection. The proposed method uses the suffix array for copied substring detection and it can judge each blog with time complexity of (m<sup>2</sup> log n) where n and m denote total length of documents used for copy detection and the lengths of the blog to be judged, respectively.

AB  - In a Heterogeneous distributed Environment, communication between the group members must be secured and authenticated. In a group, the member contribution in forming the group key is important. But forming a group key in a efficient manner is and to minimize the complexity in forming the group key, we are proposing a new protocol which consumes minimum number of key computations, less communication costs and number of keys stored in a server. Group members are in dynamic nature even one join/ leave the group the group key must be revoked and the new must be generated to maintain the forward and backward secrecy. If group members are large then the scalability problem also arises. In particular, cost for key establishment and key renewing is usually relevant to the group size and subsequently becomes a performance bottleneck in achieving scalability. To address this problem, for wired / wireless communication our new approach that features decoupling of group size and computation cost for group key management. By using a Cluster based Hierarchical Key Distribution Protocol, the load of key management can be shared by a cluster of dummy nodes without revealing group messages to them. The proposed scheme provides better scalability because the Key Computation cost is log<sub>8</sub> [n|m] and Communication cost is 0(1), the key server storage cost is [d/d -1]m+n, n &#x226B;m. Our proposed protocol provides the best performance in communication, key computations and the key server storage cost than existing approaches and it is applicable for wired / wireless environments also.

AB  - Social network analysis has recently gained a lot of interest because of the advent and the increasing popularity of social media, such as blogs, social networks, micro logging, or customer review sites. Such media often serve as platforms for information dissemination and product placement or promotion. In this environment, influence and trust are becoming essential qualities among user interactions. In this work, we perform an extensive study of various metrics related to the aforementioned elements, and their effect in the process of information propagation in the virtual world. In order to better understand the properties of links and the dynamics of social networks, we distinguish between permanent and transient links and in the latter case, we consider the link freshness. Moreover, we distinguish between local and global influence and compare suggestions provided by locally or globally trusted users.

We are currently developing series of analytical models to use potential benefits of multiple sensors for reducing false alarms. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss implementation of prototype multisensor based intrusion detection system. We are especially interested in analyzing traffic that has an abnormal or malicious character and should prompt a closer look. A specific feature of the model is that the systems use multiple sensors to process log files

AB  - We all have a large amount of data stored in Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Google Docs and many other online services. With the increasingly importance of these online data, we need an effective way to protect it. This paper proposes a personal data storage system, UPDS, to improve personal data's availability and durability. Two common approaches to improve availability and durability are complete replication and parity scheme such as erasure coding. Although the erasure coding scheme can reduce storage cost, the self-contained feature of online service data source increases its bandwidth cost and decreases its durability. Leveraging the temporal locality of personal data's access model, we propose a lazy-committed log-structure storage architecture and content-based block striping technology to solve the problem. This paper explores the distributed storage system on self-contained data source for the first time and analyzes it system model. The system analysis results show that UPDS can improve availability and durability of personal data at low cost.

It deals with the concurrency control anomalies, and, simultaneously, assures the reliability of the data before read-write transactions and after successfully committed. It can be used within the distributed database to track data logs and roll back processes to overcome distributed database anomalies. The method is based on commit timestamps for validation and an integer flag that is incremented each time a successful update on the record is committed.

If an MLSI is found, then IDA judges whether the MLSI is accompanied by an intrusion. We adopt discriminant analysis to analyze information after IDA detects an MLSI in a remote attack. Discriminant analysis provides a classification function that allows IDA to separate intrusive activities from non-intrusive activities. Using discriminant analysis, we can detect intrusions by analyzing only a part of system calls occurring on a host machine, and we can determine whether an unknown sample is an intrusion. In this paper, we explain in detail how we perform discriminant analysis to detect intrusions, and evaluate the classification function. We also describe how to extract a sample from system logs, which is necessary to implement the discriminant analysis function in IDA

AB  - We address the issue of asserting the accuracy of coordinates advertised by nodes of Internet coordinate systems during distance estimations. Indeed, some nodes may lie deliberately about their coordinates to mount various attacks against applications and overlays. Our proposed method consists in two steps: 1) establish the correctness of a node's claimed coordinate (which leverages our previous work on securing the coordinates embedding phase using a Surveyor infrastructure); and 2) issue a time limited validity certificate for each verified coordinate. Validity periods are computed based on an analysis of coordinate inter-shift times observed on PlanetLab, and shown to follow a long-tail distribution (lognormal distribution in most cases, or Weibull distribution otherwise). The effectiveness of the coordinate certification method is validated by measuring the impact of a variety of attacks on distance estimates.

AB  - Most of the currently available intrusion detection systems do not provide any authentication functionality in order to identify the users who access a computer system. In particular, insiders are able to misuse their privileges without being detected. Some intrusion detection systems aim to authenticate legitimate users once they log in to the system, as well as to prevent access to unauthorized people who try to impersonate other users. The main goal of this paper is to introduce and implement a novel approach that uses the fingerprint technique to complement a host-based intrusion detection system in order to improve its level of authentication, which would allow us to detect more effectively any misuse of the computer system that is running it.

AB  - After the detection of a cyber attack on a database system, the intrusion response team of any organization needs to know the damage profile immediately in order to design an appropriate response strategy. Unfortunately obtaining the precise damage status can take up to hours even days. This is because existing approaches to database damage assessment involve significant amount of work including scanning the log file or other auxiliary data structures. Our approach concentrates on making an estimated damage profile as soon as possible. This model is based exclusively on a priori knowledge of data relationships mined during normal database operation phase. This knowledge can be used during damage assessment phase for faster damage assessment.

AB  - Continuous data protection, which logs every update to a file system, is an enabling technology to protect file systems against malicious attacks and/or user mistakes, because it allows each file update to be undoable. Existing implementations of continuous data protection work either at disk access interface or within the file system. Despite the implementation complexity, their performance overhead is significant when compared with file systems that do not support continuous data protection. Moreover, such kernel-level file update logging implementation is complex and cannot be easily ported to other operating systems. This paper describes the design and implementation of four user-level continuous data protection implementations for NFS servers, all of which work on top of the NFS protocol and thus can be easily ported to any operating systems that support NFS. Measurements obtained from running standard benchmarks and real-world NFS traces on these user-level continuous data protection systems demonstrate a surprising result: Performance of NFS servers protected by pure user-level continuous data protection schemes is comparable to that of unprotected vanilla NFS servers.

AB  - Due to the prevalence of distributed and coordinated Internet attacks, many researchers and network administrators study the nature and strategies of attackers. To analyze event logs, using intrusion detection systems and active network monitoring, honeynets are being deployed to attract potential attackers in order to investigate their modus operandi. The goal is to use honeynet clusters as real-time warning systems in production networks. Towards satisfying this objective, we have built a honeynet cluster and have run experiments to determine its effectiveness. Majority of the honeynets function in isolation, not sharing information in real time. In order to rectify this deficiency, the authors built a federation of cooperating honeynets (referred to as knowledge sharing honeynets) that shares knowledge of malicious traffic. This paper describes the methods in building a hardware assisted honeynet cluster and testing its effectiveness.

AB  - A black hole is a highly harmful host that disposes of visiting agents upon their arrival without any observable trace of the destruction. The problem of locating the black hole in asynchronous ring network is known to be solvable by a team of mobile agents if each node is equipped with a whiteboard. A simpler and less expensive inter-communication and synchronization mechanism is provided by tokens: each agent has available a bounded number of tokens that can be carried, placed in a node or/and on a port of the node, or removed. All tokens are identical and no other form of communication or coordination is available to the agents. It is known that locating the black hole in an anonymous ring network using tokens is feasible when the team of agents is initially collocated (i.e. they all start from the same host). Recently, the more difficult case when the agents are scattered (i.e., when the agents do not start from the same host) has also been examined and solutions requiring only O(1) tokens per agent but using a total of O(n<sup>2</sup>) moves have been presented. The number of moves can be reduced to O(kn + n log n) if the number k of agents is known. In this paper, we study the impact of orientation and knowledge of team size on the cost of black hole location by scattered agents with tokens. We prove that, in oriented rings, the number of moves can be reduced from O(n<sup>2</sup>) to the optimal Theta(nlogn) using only O(1) tokens per agent, without any knowledge of the team size. This result holds even if both agents and nodes are anonymous. Interestingly, the proposed algorithm solves, with the same cost, also the leader election problem and the rendezvous problem for the scattered agents despite the presence of a BH.

AB  - Shoulder-surfing is a known risk where an attacker can capture a password by direct observation or by recording the authentication session. Due to the visual interface, this problem has become exacerbated in graphical passwords. There have been some graphical schemes resistant or immune to shoulder-surfing, but they have significant usability drawbacks, usually in the time and effort to log in. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new shoulder-surfing resistant scheme which has a desirable usability for PDAs. Our inspiration comes from the drawing input method in DAS and the association mnemonics in Story for sequence retrieval. The new scheme requires users to draw a curve across their password images orderly rather than click directly on them. The drawing input trick along with the complementary measures, such as erasing the drawing trace, displaying degraded images, and starting and ending with randomly designated images provide a good resistance to shoulder-surfing. A preliminary user study showed that users were able to enter their passwords accurately and to remember them over time.

Several anti-cheating solutions have been developed by gaming companies. However, most of these companies use cheating detection measures that may involve breaches to users' privacy. In our paper, we provide a server-side anti-cheating solution that uses only game logs. Our method is based on defining an honest player's behavior and cheaters' behavior first. After that, using machine learning classifiers to train cheating models, then detect cheaters. We presented our results in different organizations to show different options for developers, and our methods' results gave a very high accuracy in most of the cases. Finally, we provided a detailed analysis of our results with some useful suggestions for online games developers.

AB  - The faults in today's telecommunication systems happen frequently. The reason is simply the complexity of the telecommunication networks and other supported hardware. Various parts of the network may be supplied by various vendors, thus adding to the overall operational complexity. Furthermore these networks may consist of various types of networks, e.g. computer, switching, circuit and wireless networks, inter-operating. The result of such complexities is that a number of faults will happen over unit time intervals. Many of these faults may result in denial of service to the end users, consequently causing revenue losses to the telecommunication companies. Therefore various fault prediction and correction techniques have been proposed. Most, if not all, of these techniques are based on analysis of the historical alarm logs. The Telecom Alarm Sequence Analyzer (TASA) project has proposed associate and episodal rules for historical alarms. We have practically applied TASA episodal rules to identify sequence of alarms and then used the probabilities of these alarm sequences to predict future sequences of alarms. We have used the proposed alarm prediction technique on the real time alarm data of a telecommunication company and predicted future alarms sequences. Furthermore we have compared the predicted alarms against the actual alarm sequences to check the accuracy of our technique. The proposed technique does not make any assumption about the alarm data. We have concluded that the proposed technique has practical usage for alarm prediction in telecommunication networks.

AB  - Web-based applications store their data at the server side. This design has several benefits, but it can also cause a serious problem because a misconfiguration, bug or vulnerability leading to data loss or corruption can affect many users. While data backup solutions can help resolve some of these issues, they do not help diagnose the events that led to the corruption or the precise set of changes caused by these events. In this paper, we describe the design of a recovery system that helps administrators recover from data corruption caused by bugs in web applications. Our system tracks application requests, helping identify requests that cause data corruption, and reuses undo logs already kept by databases to selectively recover from the effects of these requests. The main challenge is to correlate requests across the multiple tiers of the application to determine the correct recovery actions. We explore using dependencies both within and across requests at three layers (database, application, and client) to help identify data corruption accurately. We evaluate our system using known bugs in popular web applications, including Wordpress, Drupal and Gallery2. Our results show that our system enables recovery from data corruption without loss of critical data and incurs small runtime overhead.

AB  - Flash-crowd attacks are the most vicious form of distributed denial of service (DDoS). They flood the victim with service requests generated from numerous bots. Attack requests are identical in content to those generated by legitimate, human users, and bots send at a low rate to appear non-aggressive - these features defeat many existing DDoS defenses. We propose defenses against flash-crowd attacks via human behavior modeling, which differentiate DDoS bots from human users. Current approaches to human-vs-bot differentiation, such as graphical puzzles, are insufficient and annoying to humans, whereas our defenses are highly transparent. We model three aspects of human behavior: a) request dynamics, by learning several chosen features of human interaction dynamics, and detecting bots that exhibit higher aggressiveness in one or more of these features, b) request semantics, by learning transitional probabilities of user requests, and detecting bots that generate valid but low-probability sequences, and c) ability to process visual cues, by embedding into server replies human-invisible objects, which cannot be detected by automated analysis, and flagging users that visit them as bots. We evaluate our defenses' performance on a series of Web traffic logs, interlaced with synthetically generated attacks, and conclude that they raise the bar for a successful, sustained attack to botnets whose size is larger than the size observed in 1-5% of DDoS attacks today.

AB  - Network operators are increasingly using analytic applications to improve the performance of their networks. Telecommunications analytical applications typically use SQL and Complex Event Processing (CEP) for data processing, network analysis and troubleshooting. Such approaches are hindered as they require an in-depth knowledge of both the telecommunications domain and telecommunications data structures in order to create the required queries. Valuable information contained in free form text data fields such as &#x201C;additional_info&#x201D;, &#x201C;user_text&#x201D; or &#x201C;problem_text&#x201D; can also be ignored. This work proposes An Anomaly Detection Algorithm for MAintenance and Network Troubleshooting (ADAMANT), a text analytic based network anomaly detection approach. Once telecommunications data records have been indexed, ADAMANT uses distance based outlier detection within sliding windows to detect abnormal terms at configurable time intervals. Traditional approaches focus on a specific type of record and create specific cause and effect rules. With the ADAMANT approach all free form text fields of alarms, logs, etc. are treated as text documents similar to Twitter feeds. All documents within a window represent a snapshot of the network state that is processed by ADAMANT. The ADAMANT approach focuses on text analytics to provide automated analysis without the requirement for SQL/CEP queries. Such an approach provides distinct network insights in comparison to traditional approaches.

AB  - Web server attacks are increasingly in short time for different purposes, one of the principal vectors of this attacks are RFI and even the automatic way to do this. We suppose that in a botnet involved in RFI attacks, the attackers (host that launch the attack) are web servers compromised since the natural format of the attack and the tool (remote file to include). So we go deeper identified the type of host that is the attacker through a remote analysis based on domain name, content, and dynamic ip addresses.A large botnet involved in RFI attacks was tracked by almost a year and we figure out the behavior and the kind of host are the attackers and the hosters. This track were made by one University web server logs, compared with other sources. The interesting facts founded here are related to the botnet selected to study. This botnet is formed by other kind of hosts, not web servers at all. And the tool used to compromise web server is a very general shell. Other contribution of this work is a methodology for tracking RFI botnets, that could be used in real time or for historical data.

AB  - This paper investigates a location-based authentication system where authentication questions are generated based on users' locations tracked by smartphones. More specifically, the system builds a location profile for a user based on periodically logged Wi-Fi access point beacons over time, and leverages this location profile to generate authentication questions. To evaluate the various aspects of this location-based authentication approach, we deployed the application on users' smartphones and conducted a real-life study for one month with 14 users. To simulate various kinds of adversaries (e.g., Naive vs. Knowledgeable), in our study, we recruited volunteers in pairs (e.g., Friends), in addition to single participants. Over the course of the experiment, each user is periodically presented with two sets of authentication questions. The first set is generated based on a user's own data. The second set is generated based on a randomly selected user's data. Additionally, in cases of paired participants, each user is presented with a third set of questions which is generated based on the user's friend's data. In each case, three different kinds of questions of varying difficulty levels are generated and presented to the user. Finally, we present a Bayesian classifier based authentication algorithm that can authenticate legitimate users with high accuracy by leveraging individual response patterns. We also discuss various aspects of location-based authentication mechanisms based on our findings in this paper.

AB  - Terrorist attacks and natural disasters like Tsunami made us realize the need for rapid and precise personal identification. Biometrics systems and mainly multi-biometric systems provide tools to enforce reliable logs of system transactions and protect an individual's right to privacy. Passwords and user ids are often passed, written down for convenience or reused multiple times in different networks. Biometric logins would make it unfeasible for anyone, other than the intended person to login to the network or system but at the same time no need to remember passwords and user ids. Governments, law enforcement agencies, military and industrial companies are already making partial use of this technology. Researchers and practitioners are integrating identifying technologies into robotics, human computer interfaces, gaming systems, mobile devices, door locks, automobiles, and so on. Government of India is introducing biometric based authentication system for all Indian citizens. This paper describes different types of biometric practices, recent trend of using biometrics, biometric fusion and its uses in India.

AB  - Alert fusion is a key problem in distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS). The paper proposes a distributed intrusion alert fusion scheme based on multiple keywords and routing infrastructure: distributed hash table (DHT). All the related alerts produced by local sensor can be routed and fused to their corresponding peers by multiple keywords, while evenly distributing unrelated alerts to different peer. We evaluation our scheme with a real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected firewall and NIDS logs from over 1600 administrators across the world. Experimental results show that our scheme has well scalable, and can achieve significant improvement in load balancing.

AB  - How can we find useful patterns and anomalies in large scale real-world data with multiple attributes? For example, network intrusion logs, with (source-ip, target-ip, port-number, timestamp)? Tensors are suitable for modeling these multi-dimensional data, and widely used for the analysis of social networks, web data, network traffic, and in many other settings. However, current tensor decomposition methods do not scale for tensors with millions and billions of rows, columns and `fibers', that often appear in real datasets. In this paper, we propose HaTen2, a scalable distributed suite of tensor decomposition algorithms running on the MapReduce platform. By carefully reordering the operations, and exploiting the sparsity of real world tensors, HaTen2 dramatically reduces the intermediate data, and the number of jobs. As a result, using HaTen2, we analyze big real-world tensors that can not be handled by the current state of the art, and discover hidden concepts.

AB  - Web personalization is an elegant and flexible process of making a web site responsive to the unique needs of each individual user. Data that reflects user preferences and likings, comprising therefore a user profile, are gathered to an adaptive web site in a non transparent manner. This situation however raises serious privacy concerns to the end user. When browsing aweb site, users are not aware of several important privacy parameters i.e., which behavior will be monitored and logged, how it will be processed, how long it will be kept, and with whom it will be shared in the long run. In this paper we propose an abstract architecture that enhances user privacy during interaction with adaptive web sites. This architecture enables users to create and update their personal privacy preferences for the adaptive web sites they visit by holding their (user) profiles in the client side instead of the server side. By doing so users will be able to self-confine the personalization experience the adaptive sites offer, thus enhancing privacy.

AB  - The Domain Name System (DNS) is an essential part of the Internet infrastructure and provides fundamental services, such as translating host names into IP addresses for Internet communication. The DNS is vulnerable to a number of potential faults and attacks. In particular, false routing announcements can deny access to the DNS service or redirect DNS queries to a malicious impostor Due to the hierarchical DNS design, a single fault or attack against the routes to any of the top level DNS servers can disrupt Internet services to millions of users. In this paper we propose a path-filtering approach to protect the routes to the critical top level DNS servers. Our approach exploits the high degree of redundancy in top level DNS servers and also exploits the observation that popular destinations, including top level DNS servers, are well connected via stable routes. Our path-filter restricts the potential top level DNS server route changes to be within a set of established paths. Heuristics derived from routing operations are used to adjust the potential routes overtime. We tested our path-filtering design against BGP routing logs and the results show that the design can effectively ensure correct routes to top level DNS servers without impacting DNS service availability.

AB  - Honeypots are decoys designed to trap, delay, and gather information about attackers. We can use honeypot logs to analyze attackers' behaviors and design new defenses. A virtual honeypot can emulate multiple honeypots on one physical machine and provide great flexibility in representing one or more networks of machines. But when attackers recognize a honeypot, it becomes useless. In this paper, we address issues related to detecting and "camouflaging" virtual honeypots, in particular Honeyd, which can emulate any size of network on physical machines. We find that an attacker may remotely fingerprint Honeyd by measuring the latency of the network links emulated by Honeyd. We analyze the threat from this fingerprint attack based on the Neyman-Pearson decision theory and find that this class of attack can achieve a high detection rate and low false alarm rate. In order to counter this fingerprint attack, we make virtual honeypots behave like their surrounding networks and blend in with their surroundings. We design a camouflaged Honeyd by revising a small part of the Honeyd toolkit code and by appropriately patching the operating system. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to camouflaging Honeyd

AB  - Block-level continuous data protection (CDP) logs every disk write operation so that the disk can be rolled back to any arbitrary point-in-time within a time window. For each update operation is time stamped and logged, the indexing for such huge amounts of records is an important and challenging problem. Unfortunately, the conventional indexing methods can not efficiently record large numbers of versions and support instant &#x201C;time-travel&#x201D; types of queries in CDP. In this paper, we present an effective indexing method providing timely recovery to any point-in-time in comprehensive versioning systems, called the Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Indexing Method (HSTIM). The basic principle of HSTIM is to partition the time domain and the production storage LBAs into time slice and segments respectively according to update frequency of disk IOs, and build separate index file for each segment. In order to meet the demands of instant view of history data, the metadata of production storage is independently indexed. For long-time history data retrieval requirements, index snapshot is introduced in HSTIM to reduce the retrieval time. Another distinctive feature of HSTIM is its incremental retrieval method, which achieves high query performance at time point t + t if neighboring time point t is queried previously. The paper compares HSTIM with traditional B+-tree and multi-version B-tree (MVBT) index in many aspects. Experiments with real workload IO trace files show that HSTIM can locate history data within 8.05 seconds for recovery point of 48 hours, while B+-tree consumes 24.04 seconds. If the index snapshot is applied, HSTIM can reduce such retrieval time within 3 seconds.

AB  - Cloud computing is an emerging technology that allows users to utilize on-demand computation, storage, data and services from around the world. However, Cloud service providers charge users for these services. Specifically, to access data from their globally distributed storage edge servers, providers charge users depending on the user's location and the amount of data transferred. When deploying data-intensive applications in a Cloud computing environment, optimizing the cost of transferring data to and from these edge servers is a priority, as data play the dominant role in the application's execution. In this paper, we formulate a non-linear programming model to minimize the data retrieval and execution cost of data-intensive workflows in Clouds. Our model retrieves data from Cloud storage resources such that the amount of data transferred is inversely proportional to the communication cost. We take an example of an `intrusion detection' application workflow, where the data logs are made available from globally distributed Cloud storage servers. We construct the application as a workflow and experiment with Cloud based storage and compute resources. We compare the cost of multiple executions of the workflow given by a solution of our non-linear program against that given by Amazon CloudFront's `nearest' single data source selection. Our results show a savings of three-quarters of total cost using our model.

AB  - A block-level continuous data protection (CDP) system logs every disk block update from an application server (e.g., a file or DBMS server) to a storage system so that any disk updates within a time window are undoable, and thus is able to provide a more flexible and efficient data protection service than conventional periodic data backup systems. Unfortunately, no existing block-level CDP systems can support arbitrary point-in-time snapshots that are guaranteed to be consistent with respect to the metadata of the application server. This deficiency seriously limits the flexibility in recovery point objective (RTO) of block-level CDP systems from the standpoint of the application servers whose data they protect. This paper describes an incremental file system check mechanism (iFSCK) that is designed to address this deficiency for file servers, and exploits file system-specific knowledge to quickly fix an arbitrary point-in-time block-level snapshot so that it is consistent with respect to file system metadata. Performance measurements taken from a fully operational iFSCK prototype show that iFSCK can turn a 10 GB point-in-time block-level snapshot to be file-system consistent in less than 1 second, and takes less than 25% of the time required by the Fsck utility for vanilla ext3 under relaxed metadata consistency requirements.

AB  - Large-scale computing systems provide great potential for scientific exploration. However, the complexity that accompanies these enormous machines raises challenges for both, users and operators. The effective use of such systems is often hampered by failures encountered when running applications on systems containing tens-of-thousands of nodes and hundreds-of-thousands of compute cores capable of yielding petaflops of performance. In systems of this size failure detection is complicated and root-cause diagnosis difficult. This paper describes our recent work in the identification of anomalies in monitoring data and system logs to provide further insights into machine status, runtime behavior, failure modes and failure root causes. It discusses the details of an initial prototype that gathers the data and uses statistical techniques for analysis.

AB  - Data mining provides a useful environment and set of tools for processing large datasets such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) logs. Researchers improve existing IDS models by comparing the performance of various algorithms on these datasets. It is very important to keep in mind that an IDS often has to work in a noisy network environment. Network noise is one of the most challenging issues for efficient threat detection and classification. In this study, normal and noisy datasets for network IDS domain are used and various classification algorithms are evaluated. The results show that an evaluation of algorithms without noise is misleading for IDSs since algorithms that perform best without noise do not necessarily achieve the same in a realistic noisy environment. Moreover refined NSL KDD dataset allows a more realistic evaluation of various algorithms than the original KDD 99 dataset.

AB  - When decisions need to be made in government, the intelligence community (IC) is tasked with analyzing the situation. This analysis is based on a huge amount of information and usually under severe time constraints. As such, it is particularly vulnerable to attacks from insiders with malicious intent. A malicious insider may alter, fabricate, or hide critical information in their analytical products, such as reports, in order to interfere with the decision making process. In this paper, we focus on detecting such malicious insiders. Malicious actions such as disinformation tend to be very subtle and thus difficult to detect. Therefore, we employ a user modeling technique to model an insider based on logged information and documents accessed while accomplishing an intelligence analysis task. We create a computational model for each insider and apply several detection metrics to analyze this model as it changes over time. If any deviation of behavior is detected, alerts can be issued. A pilot test revealed that the computed deviations had a high correlation with insiderspsila cognitive styles. Based on this finding, we designed a framework that minimized the impact of differences in cognitive styles. In our evaluation, we used data collected from intelligence analysts, and simulated malicious insiders based on this data. A high percentage of the simulated malicious insiders were successfully detected.

AB  - As DDoS attackers pursue monetary profit, critical Internet sites (CISs) become a good target. These attacks will be more difficult to defend because the botnet size continuously increases, and the attackers spare no pains in preparing the attacks. Under this new paradigm, current anti-DDoS systems may be fooled; we need a new survival strategy. We propose a novel DDoS mitigation scheme for CISs. We observe that CISs can continue their main businesses if most important clients can access the services. This motivates us to build a whitelist, called a VIP list in this article, and the source addresses in the list are given higher priority when the CIS is under attack. The VIP list is built from the previous login logs of authentication processes at the application layer. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme effectively mitigates DDoS attacks.

AB  - This paper focuses on agent-based enterprise information technology infrastructure support for privacy in the Web services architecture (WSA) in order to enforce privacy policies on private information (PI) used by applications. We provision the Web services platform (WSP) with mechanisms to not only enforce privacy policies on PI used by a Web service, but also gather intelligence about PI that is exchanged in invoking and executing Web services. Gathered information written in logs is then analyzed by a privacy agent to update a privacy knowledge base (KB) that captures information on applications, Web services they invoke, context of invocation, and PI stored, managed, and used by the enterprise. This loop-observe execution of Web services, update the knowledge base with observations, and then update rules governing privacy enforcement, provides for adaptive learning about the use of PI in the organization and also enforcement of privacy policies in Web services executions.

AB  - This paper explores a hybrid approach of intrusion detection through knowledge discovery from big data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We identify the "hidden" patterns of operations conducted by both normal users and malicious users from a large volume of network/systems logs, by mapping this problem to the topic modeling problem and leveraging the well established LDA models and learning algorithms. This new approach potentially completes the strength of signature-based and anomaly-based methods.

AB  - Although conventional database management systems are designed to tolerate hardware and to a lesser extent even software errors, they cannot protect themselves against syntactically correct and semantically damaging transactions, which could arise because of malicious attacks or honest mistakes. The lack of fast post-intrusion or post-error damage repair in modern DBMSs results in a longer Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and sometimes permanent data loss that could have been saved by more intelligent repair mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of Phoenix - a system that significantly improves the efficiency and precision of a database damage repair process after an intrusion or operator error and thus, increases the overall database system availability. The two key ideas underlying Phoenix are (1) maintaining persistent inter-transaction dependency information at run time to allow selective undo of database transactions that are considered "infected" by the intrusion or error in question and (2) exploiting information present in standard database logs for fast selective undo. Performance measurements on a fully operational Phoenix prototype, which is based on the PostgreSQL DBMS, demonstrate that Phoenix incurs a response time and a throughput penalty of less than 5% and 8%, respectively, under the TPC-C benchmark, but it can speed up the post-intrusion database repair process by at least an order of magnitude when compared with a manual repair process.

AB  - Information retrieval (IR) approaches have proven useful in recovering traceability links between free text documentation and source code. IR-based traceability recovery approaches produce ranked lists of traceability links between pieces of documentation and source code. These traceability links are then pruned using various strategies and, finally, validated by human experts. In this paper we propose two contributions to improve the precision and recall of traceability links and, thus, reduces the required human experts' manual validation effort. First, we propose a novel approach, Trustrace, inspired by Web trust models to improve the precision and recall of traceability links: Trustrace uses any traceability recovery approach to obtain a set of traceability links, which rankings are then re-evaluated using a set of other traceability recovery approaches. Second, we propose a novel traceability recovery approach, Histrace, to identify traceability links between requirements and source code through CVS/SVN change logs using a Vector Space Model (VSM). We combine a traditional recovery traceability approach with Histrace to build Trustrace<sup>VSM, Histrace</sup> in which we use Histrace as one expert adding knowledge to the traceability links extracted from CVS/SVN change logs. We apply Trustrace<sup>VSM, Histrace</sup> on two case studies to compare its traceability links with those recovered using only the VSM-based approach, in terms of precision and recall. We show that Trustrace<sup>VSM, Histrace</sup> improves with statistical significance the precision of the traceability links while also improving recall but without statistical significance.

AB  - In large-scale cloud computing systems, even a simple user request may go through numerous of services that are deployed on different physical machines. As a result, it is a great challenge to online localize the prime causes of performance degradation in such systems. Existing end-to-end request tracing approaches are not suitable for online anomaly detection because their time complexity is exponential in the size of the trace logs. In this paper, we propose an approach, namely Magnifier, to rapidly diagnose the source of performance degradation in large-scale non-stop cloud systems. In Magnifier, the execution path graph of a user request is modeled by a hierarchical structure including component layer, module layer and function layer, and anomalies are detected from higher layer to lower layer separately. In each layer every node is assigned a newly created identifier in addition to the global identifier of the request, which significantly decreases the size of parsing trace logs and accelerates the anomaly detection process. We conduct extensive experiments over a real-world enterprise system (the Alibaba cloud computing platform) providing services for the public. The results show that Magnifier can locate the prime causes of performance degradation more accurately and efficiently.

AB  - Problem determination and resolution PDR is the process of detecting anomalies in a monitored system, locating the problems responsible for the issue, determining the root cause and fixing the cause of the problem. The cost of PDR represents a substantial part of operational costs, and faster, more effective PDR can contribute to a substantial reduction in system administration costs. In this paper, we propose to automate the process of PDR by leveraging machine learning methods. The main focus is to effectively categorize the problem a user experiences by recognizing the problem specificity leveraging all available training data such like the performance data and the logs data. Specifically, we transform the structure of the problem into a hierarchy which can be determined by existing taxonomy in advance. We then propose an efficient hierarchical incremental learning algorithm which is capable of adjusting its internal local classifier parameters in real-time. Comparing to the traditional batch learning algorithms, this online learning framework can significantly decrease the computational complexity of the training process by learning from new instances on an incremental fashion. In the same time this reduces the amount of memory required to store the training instances. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by learning hierarchical problem patterns for several issues occurring in distributed web applications. Experimental results show that our approach substantially outperforms previous methods.

AB  - We present a novel paradigm for visual correlation of network alerts from disparate logs. This paradigm facilitates and promotes situational awareness in complex network environments. Our approach is based on the notion that, by definition, an alert must possess three attributes, namely: what, when, and where. This fundamental premise, which we term w<sup>3</sup>, provides a vehicle for comparing between seemingly disparate events. We propose a concise and scalable representation of these three attributes, that leads to a flexible visualization tool that is also clear and intuitive to use. Within our system, alerts can be grouped and viewed hierarchically with respect to both their type, i.e., the what, and to their where attributes. Further understanding is gained by displaying the temporal distribution of alerts to reveal complex attack trends. Finally, we propose a set of visual metaphor extensions that augment the proposed paradigm and enhance users' situational awareness. These metaphors direct the attention of users to many-to-one correlations within the current display helping them detect abnormal network activity.

AB  - Block-level continuous data protection (CDP) logs every disk block update so that disk updates within a time window are undoable. Standard file servers and DBMS servers can enjoy the data protection service offered by block-level CDP without any modification. Unfortunately, no existing block-level CDP systems can provide users a file versioning view on top of the block versions they maintain. As a result, the data they maintain cannot be used as an extension to the on-line system with which users routinely interact. This paper describes a name-based user-level file versioning system called UVFS that is designed to reconstruct file versions from disk block versions maintained by a block-level CDP. UVFS reconstructs file versions by following the last modified time of files and directories, a common file metadata supported by almost all modern file systems, and therefore does not require any modification to the host file system that a block-level CDP system protects. In addition, UVFS incorporates a file system-specific incremental consistency check mechanism to quickly convert an arbitrary point-in-time block-level snapshot to a file system-consistent one. Performance measurements taken from a fully operational UVFS prototype show that the average end-to-end elapsed time required to discover a file version is under 50 msec from the perspective of an NFS client serviced by an NFS server backed by a block-level CDP system.

AB  - Web based applications are increasing at an enormous speed and consequently its users are also increasing at an exponential speed. The evolutionary changes in technology have made it possible to capture the users' essence and interactions with web applications through web server log file as web usage. The web usage Mining (WUM) is the process of discovering hidden patterns from the web usage. Due to large amount of &#x201C;irrelevant information&#x201D; in the web log, the original log file cannot be directly used in the WUM process. Therefore, the preprocessing of web log file becomes imperative. The proper analysis of web log file is beneficial to manage the websites effectively for administrative and users' prospective. Web log preprocessing is an initial necessary step to improve the quality and efficiency of the later steps of WUM. There are number of techniques available at preprocessing level of WUM such as data cleaning; data filtering; user identification; session identification and session clustering. In this research paper, a complete preprocessing technique is being proposed to preprocess the web log for extraction of user patterns. Data cleaning algorithm removes the irrelevant entries from web log and filtering algorithm discards the uninterested attributes from log file. User and sessions are identified. Proposed hierarchical sessionization algorithm generates the hierarchy of sessions. We obtain unbiased hierarchical clusters from the web log file.

AB  - A common technique employed by software developers is the use of log files to generate traces of observed software behavior. As a resource for reverse engineering, a log file has the advantage of being an accurate account of software behavior. Model checking approaches work by using exploration to determine whether certain safety and liveness conditions are satisfied by a finite-state model. In this paper we describe an approach that combines the use of model checking and log file analysis to facilitate verification of recovered models.

AB  - Deployed software applications use log files to keep a record of system events. Log analysis provides support for system administrators to gain the knowledge of system health and behavior. As a result, the ability to efficiently search for patterns in historical events has become a major requirement for timely analysis. Enterprise systems today produce high volumes of log data, regularly in the order of thousands of events per second, which requires to build inverted indexes for quick data retrieval. However, current inverted indexing techniques are rarely designed to handle high volumes of dynamic stream data and often resource consuming. We propose an efficient indexing solution, which reduces the necessary resources by employing bloom filter techniques. The solution builds a generic indexing engine for the Run Time Correlation Engine logging framework to achieve efficient monitoring in the Cloud. In particular, our solution is able to deliver significant performance improvement over existing indexing engines.

AB  - Web-based interactive applications may combine the interactive and tailored nature of successful behavior change interventions with the wide reach needed to target the general population. There is a lack of insight in the requirements for successful interactive Web-based applications in prevention. The objective of this research is to evaluate the Healthy Weight Assistant (HWA) of the Netherlands Nutrition Centre and give recommendations for optimization of this application. This study consists of questionnaires (n=703, follow-up n=431), real-time usability-tests, log-file analysis and qualitative analysis. From the preliminary results we see that improvement with maximum effect and minimal change of the HWA can be found in motivation to keep using the application and motivation to change behavior. This can be achieved by sending automatic (tailored) reminders, restructuring the second stage in the application (motivation and goal setting) and by adding a tab 'my goals' to the application.

AB  - This paper describes an evaluation of the reverse engineering capabilities of three Web tools for understanding site content and structure. The evaluation is based on partitioning Web sites into three classes (static, interactive, and dynamic), and is structured using an existing reverse engineering environment framework (REEF). This case study also represents an initial evaluation of the applicability of the REEF in the related but qualitatively different domain of Web sites. The case study highlights several shortcomings of current Web tools in the context of aiding understanding to support evolution. For example, most Web tools are geared towards new page design and development, not to understanding detailed page content or overall site structure. The evaluation also identified some aspects of the REEF that might benefit from refinement to better reflect Web tool capabilities that support common evolution tasks. For example, Web server log file analysis as a specialized form of data gathering and subsequence information presentation.

AB  - This paper describes a novel method for detecting the bottleneck in a discrete event system by examining the average duration of a machine being active for all machines. The machine with the longest average uninterrupted active period is considered the bottleneck. The method is widely applicable and also capable of analyzing complex and sophisticated systems. The results are highly accurate, distinguishing between bottleneck machines and non-bottleneck machines with a high level of confidence. This approach is very easy to use and can be implemented into existing simulation tools with little effort, requiring only an analysis of the log file which is readily available by almost all simulation tools. This method satisfies not only academic requirements with respect to accuracy but also industry requirements with respect to usability

We used two different research methods, non-anonymous questionnaire and usage analysis that is in fact a relatively hidden form of gaining the data about the users in e-course. Our research question should be formed as follows: Is there a significant difference between the answers of questionnaire investigation and real behaviour of the students in the e-course? This question was stated after the first differences between how students responded in the questionnaire and what the analysis of log file proved emerged. Comparing the answers and outcomes of usage analysis we are able to find out the real process of the participants' study and eventually interpret the differences.

AB  - Currently, user requirements of the World Wide Web are diverse, growing more so with each passing year. Furthermore, each web user wants to retrieve data and/or merchandise more conveniently and quickly. As a result of different search criteria and dispositions of web users, data retrieval leads to unnecessarily repetitious operations in the use of the environment implemented by web designers. In this paper, we will suggest a system that analyzes user patterns on the Web using the technique of log file analysis and then transfers the web site information of users effectively. We analyzed the log files for customer data using EC-Miner, one of the tools used in data mining, and offered an appropriate layout, corresponding with personalization by giving a weight to each transport path.

AB  - This paper investigates the role of language in accessing information on the Internet. We combined data about website visitors through log-file analysis with data about web-hosts and links obtained from a crawler. Results suggest that language may represent a double barrier: first, the number of native speakers determines the number of web-hosts, and hence the amount of information and the interconnectedness of information sources. Second, to access information on a particular website the languages offered are an even more important factor than network effects: non-native speakers and links from websites in other languages are always underrepresented. Our results are in line with the Information Foraging Theory, the Revised Hierarchy Model, network and market theories, and emphasize the role of language on the Internet. Insight into these processes is helpful when website translation represents important investment decisions, or when aiming to diminish the digital divide.

AB  - Technical communication is often misunderstood by those outside the profession or the academic field. These outside perceptions of our work, generally based on extremely limited and narrow notions of the field, can influence the opportunities available to technical communicators. In this paper, three faculty members from the University of Washington's Department of Technical Communication describe their academic assumptions and research activities that range far beyond traditional areas from technical writing such as writing, editing and production. They describe projects that represent the expanding boundaries of the field of technical communication, spanning domains (including medicine, corporate, and public service), methods (including contextual inquiry, content analysis, case studies, and log file analysis), and solution types (including content management, user driven content, computer mediated communication, and strategic management of systems). What these projects share is abroad vision of the field of technical communication and a broad vision of the contributions that technical communication professionals have to offer.

AB  - A promising method to improve the performance of information retrieval systems is to approach retrieval tasks as a supervised classification problem. Previous user interactions, e.g. gathered from a thorough log file analysis, can be used to train classifiers which aim to inference relevance of retrieved documents based on user interactions. A problem in this approach is, however, the large imbalance ratio between relevant and non-relevant documents in the collection. In standard test collection as used in academic evaluation frameworks such as TREC, non-relevant documents outnumber relevant documents by far. In this work, we address this imbalance problem in the multimedia domain. We focus on the logs of two multimedia user studies which are highly imbalanced. We compare a naiinodotve solution of randomly deleting documents belonging to the majority class with various balancing algorithms coming from different fields: data classification and text classification. Our experiments indicate that all algorithms improve the classification performance of just deleting at random from the dominant class.
