Abstract = {{Cloud computing represents a different paradigm in the field of
   distributed computing that involves more and more researchers. We can
   see in this context the need to know exactly where, when and how a piece
   of data is processed or stored. Compared with classic digital forensic,
   the field of cloud forensic has a lot of difficulties because data is
   not stored on a single place and furthermore it implies the use of
   virtualization technologies.
   In this paper we present a new method of monitoring activity in cloud
   computing environments and datacenters by running a secure cloud
   forensic framework. We talk in detail about the capabilities that such
   system must have and we propose an architecture for it. For testing and
   results we have implemented this solution to our previous developed
   cloud computing system.}},

Abstract = {{The Insider threat is minimally addressed by current information
   security practices, yet the insider poses the most serious threat to
   organization through various malicious activities. Forensic
   investigation is a technique used to prove the presence of malicious
   insider with digital evidence. The proposed surveillance mechanism for
   countering insider threats operates in two phases. In phase one, the
   network has to be monitored for incoming and outgoing packets. The
   information is transferred using packets, and these packets are
   monitored and captured and the important features are extracted. By
   performing investigation on the captured packets, information related to
   suspicious activities can be obtained. In phase two, we mine various log
   files which are considered to posses vital traces of information when
   insider attack has been performed. The analysis of the log files is
   performed in order to extract the key pattern from files. The extracted
   patterns from log files are further processed. The suspicious data
   patterns are grouped into clusters to trace the anomaly. They are
   classified as legal and anomaly pattern with the help of KNN classifier
   .If anomaly is traced, the user's past activities are referred and a
   cross check is made with the features of captured packets the
   computational intelligence based on Dempster-Shafer theory is applied to
   prove with digital evidence, the presence of malicious insider in the
   critical networks with utmost accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{With the growing number of digital forensic tools and the increasing use
   of digital forensics in various contexts, including incident response
   and cyber threat intelligence, there is a pressing need for a widely
   accepted standard for representing and exchanging digital forensic
   information. Such a standard representation can support correlation
   between different data sources, enabling more effective and efficient
   querying and analysis of digital evidence. This work summarizes the
   strengths and weaknesses of existing schemas, and proposes the
   open-source CybOX schema as a foundation for storing and sharing digital
   forensic information. The suitability of CybOX for representing objects
   and relationships that are common in forensic investigations is
   demonstrated with examples involving digital evidence. The capability to
   represent provenance by leveraging CybOX is also demonstrated, including
   specifics of the tool used to process digital evidence and the resulting
   output. An example is provided of an ongoing project that uses CybOX to
   record the state of a system before and after an event in order to
   capture cause and effect information that can be useful for digital
   forensics. An additional open-source schema and associated ontology
   called Digital Forensic Analysis eXpression (DFAX) is proposed that
   provides a layer of domain specific information overlaid on CybOX. DFAX
   extends the capability of CybOX to represent more abstract
   forensic-relevant actions, including actions performed by subjects and
   by forensic examiners, which can be useful for sharing knowledge and
   supporting more advanced forensic analysis. DFAX can be used in
   combination with other existing schemas for representing identity
   information (CIQ), and location information (KML). This work also
   introduces and leverages initial steps of a Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO)
   effort to abstract and express concepts/constructs that are common
   across the cyber domain. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are fast becoming popular for fitness,
   sports training, and personalized healthcare applications. Securing data
   generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated
   into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical
   applications. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to secure the data
   provenance for these devices by exploiting spatio-temporal
   characteristics of the wireless channel that these devices use for
   communication. Our solution enables two parties to generate closely
   matching link fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with
   a wireless link such that a third party can later verify the details of
   the transaction, particularly the wireless link on which the data was
   transmitted. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to
   forge; they are lightweight compared with traditional provenance
   mechanisms and enable interesting security properties such as
   accountability, nonrepudiation, and resist man-in-the-middle attacks. We
   validate our technique with experiments using bodyworn sensors in
   scenarios approximating actual device deployment and present some
   extensions, which reduce energy consumption. We believe this is a
   promising first step toward using wireless-link characteristics for the
   data provenance in body area networks.}},

Abstract = {{Databases contain an enormous amount of structured data. While the use
   of forensic analysis on the file system level for creating (partial)
   timelines, recovering deleted data and revealing concealed activities is
   very popular and multiple forensic toolsets exist, the systematic
   analysis of database management systems has only recently begun.
   Databases contain a large amount of temporary data files and metadata
   which are used by internal mechanisms. These data structures are
   maintained in order to ensure transaction authenticity, to perform
   rollbacks, or to set back the database to a predefined earlier state in
   case of e. g. an inconsistent state or a hardware failure. However,
   these data structures are intended to be used by the internal system
   methods only and are in general not human-readable.
   In this work we present a novel approach for a forensic-aware database
   management system using transaction- and replication sources. We use
   these internal data structures as a vital baseline to reconstruct
   evidence during a forensic investigation. The overall benefit of our
   method is that no additional logs (such as administrator logs) are
   needed. Furthermore, our approach is invariant to retroactive malicious
   modifications by an attacker. This assures the authenticity of the
   evidence and strengthens the chain of custody. To evaluate our approach,
   we present a formal description, a prototype implementation in MySQL
   alongside and a comprehensive security evaluation with respect to the
   most relevant attack scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The notion of data provenance was formally introduced a decade ago and
   has since been investigated, but mainly from a functional perspective,
   which follows the historical pattern of introducing new technologies
   with the expectation that security and privacy can be added later.
   Despite very recent interests from the cyber security community on some
   specific aspects of data provenance, there is no long-haul, overarching,
   systematic framework for the security and privacy of provenance. The
   importance of secure provenance R\&D has been emphasized in the recent
   report on Federal game-changing R\&D for cyber security especially with
   respect to the theme of Tailored Trustworthy Spaces. Secure data
   provenance can significantly enhance data trustworthiness, which is
   crucial to various decision-making processes. Moreover, data provenance
   can facilitate accountability and compliance (including compliance with
   privacy preferences and policies of relevant users), can be an important
   factor in access control and usage control decisions, and can be
   valuable in data forensics. Along with these potential benefits, data
   provenance also poses a number of security and privacy challenges. For
   example, sometimes provenance needs to be confidential so it is visible
   only to properly authorized users, and we also need to protect the
   identity of entities in the provenance from exposure. We thus need to
   achieve high assurance of provenance without comprising privacy of those
   in the chain that produced the data. Moreover, if we expect voluntary
   large-scale participation in provenance-aware applications, we must
   assure that the privacy of the individuals or organizations involved
   will be maintained. It is incumbent on the cyber security community to
   develop a technical and scientific framework to address the security and
   privacy challenges so that our society can gain maximum benefit from
   this technology. In this paper, we discuss a framework of theoretical
   foundations, models, mechanisms and architectures that allow
   applications to benefit from privacy-enhanced and secure use of
   provenance in a modular fashion. After introducing the main components
   of such a framework and the notion of provenance life cycle, we discuss
   in details research questions and issues concerning each such component
   and related approaches.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL INVESTIGATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{S3-S12}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The forensics community is increasingly embracing the use of memory
   analysis to enhance traditional storage-based forensics techniques,
   because memory analysis yields a wealth of information not available on
   non-volatile storage. Memory analysis involves capture of a system's
   physical memory so that the live state of a system can be investigated,
   including executing and terminated processes, application data, network
   connections, and more. One aspect of memory analysis that remains
   elusive is investigation of the system's swap file, which is a backing
   store for the operating system's virtual memory system. Swap files are a
   potentially interesting source of forensic evidence, but traditionally,
   most swap file analysis has consisted of string searches and scans for
   small binary structures, which may in some cases be revelatory, but are
   also fraught with provenance issues. Unfortunately, more sophisticated
   swap file analysis is complicated by the difficulty of capturing
   mutually consistent memory dumps and swap files, the increasing use of
   swap file encryption, and other issues. Fortunately, compressed RAM
   facilities, such as those in Mac OS X Mavericks and recent versions of
   the Linux kernel, attempt to reduce or eliminate swapping to disk

Abstract = {{Secure provenance that records the ownership and process history of data
   objects is vital to the success of data forensics in cloud computing. In
   this paper, we propose a new secure provenance scheme based on group
   signature and attribute-based signature techniques. The proposed
   provenance scheme provides confidentiality on sensitive documents stored
   in a cloud, unforgeability of the provenance record, anonymous
   authentication to cloud servers, fine-grained access control on
   documents, and provenance tracking on disputed documents. Furthermore,
   it is assumed that the cloud server has huge computation capacity, while
   users are regarded as devices with low computation capability. Aiming at
   this, we show how to utilize the cloud server to outsource and decrease
   the user's computational overhead during the process of provenance. With
   provable security techniques, we formally demonstrate the security of
   the proposed scheme under standard assumptions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Cloud computing represents a rather new technology and a different
   paradigm in the field of distributed computing that involve more and
   more researchers. We can see in this context the need to know exactly
   where, when and how a piece of data is processed or stored. Compared
   with classic digital forensic, the field of cloud forensic poses a lot
   of difficulties since data is not stored on a single storage unit and
   furthermore it involves the use of virtualization technologies.
   In this paper we will present in detail a new and novel way of
   monitoring activity in cloud environments and datacenters using a secure
   cloud forensic framework. We talk about the architecture of such
   framework and how can it be applied on top of new or existing cloud
   computing deployments. Also, for testing and results collecting we have
   implemented this solution to our previous developed cloud computing

Abstract = {{The cloud has made digital forensic investigations exceedingly difficult
   due to the fact that data may be spread over an ever-changing set of
   hosts and data centres. The normal search and seizure approach that
   digital forensic investigators tend to follow does not scale well in the
   cloud because it is difficult to identify the physical devices that data
   resides on. In addition, the location of these devices is often unknown
   or unreachable. A solution to identifying the physical device can be
   found in data provenance. Similar to the tags included in an email
   header, indicating where the email originated, a tag added to data, as
   it is passed on by nodes in the cloud, identifies where the data came
   from. If such a trace can be provided for data in the cloud it may ease
   the investigating process by indicating where the data can be found. In
   this research the authors propose a model that aims to identify the
   physical location of data, both where it originated and where it has
   been as it passes through the cloud. This is done through the use of
   data provenance. The data provenance records will provide digital
   investigators with a clear record of where the data has been and where
   it can be found in the cloud.}},

Abstract = {{The provisioning of a Cloud service requires a number of parties to
   engage in a legal commitment towards one another. The responsibilities
   and expectations of both customers and providers are governed by means
   of a Service Level Agreement (SLA) contract that they sign prior the
   activation of the service. Once a Cloud service is provided by a party
   to another it is assumed that all the conditions, i.e., clauses,
   mentioned in the SLA are read and fulfilled by those who signed it. The
   notion of Forensic Readiness (FR) is introduced in literature to help
   controlling and monitoring the behaviour of a computing architecture
   through a dedicated system; the essence of this capability is motivated
   by the necessity of facilitating some digital investigations in terms of
   time and costs. In some cases, such capability can be meant also for
   alerting and prevent any system attack attempts. In the Cloud, some
   crimes can be related to violations of the previously agreed upon
   service security measures. The logging process or documentation of Cloud
   service violations can then be used by either the provider or the
   customer to evaluate the quality of the service in subject. In addition,
   they can lead any of the involved parties to take the necessary legal
   actions. In this paper we emphasize the importance of automating the
   process of discovering Service Level Agreement violations in Cloud
   services. We propose a formal framework for building a Cloud Forensic
   Readiness System (CFRS) that considers the technical aspects of SLAs
   while monitoring the fulfilment of the addressed service. The system can
   eventually issue warnings and alerts to the involved parties as soon as
   a service violation is detected. Our approach represents SLAs clauses in
   terms of formal rules that can then be used as system inputs to validate
   whether an action occurring in a given Cloud architecture is a service
   level violation or not.}},

Abstract = {{With the spectacular increase in online activities like e-transactions,
   security and privacy issues are at the peak with respect to their
   significance. Large numbers of database security breaches are occurring
   at a very high rate on daily basis. So, there is a crucial need in the
   field of database forensics to make several redundant copies of
   sensitive data found in database server artifacts, audit logs, cache,
   table storage etc. for analysis purposes. Large volume of metadata is
   available in database infrastructure for investigation purposes but most
   of the effort lies in the retrieval and analysis of that information
   from computing systems. Thus, in this paper we mainly focus on the
   significance of metadata in database forensics. We proposed a system
   here to perform forensics analysis of database by generating its
   metadata file independent of the DBMS system used. We also aim to
   generate the digital evidence against criminals for presenting it in the
   court of law in the form of who, when, why, what, how and where did the
   fraudulent transaction occur. Thus, we are presenting a system to detect
   major database attacks as well as anti-forensics attacks by developing
   an open source database forensics tool. Eventually, we are pointing out
   the challenges in the field of forensics and how these challenges can be
   used as opportunities to stimulate the areas of database forensics.}},

Abstract = {{The increased use of electronic medical records and online sharing of
   such records is motivated by improved quality of healthcare delivery.
   However, this use has raised security and privacy concerns because
   sensitive medical data could be exposed to a variety of threats that
   exist in the online world, leading to problems such as medical identity
   theft and billing fraud. If not addressed, such concerns could become a
   barrier to the large-scale adoption and sharing of electronic medical
   records. To ease such concerns, we argue that the eHealth Exchange,
   which is a federal initiative for online exchange of healthcare
   information, needs to be augmented to provide greater patient awareness
   and control. We take an approach that informs the patient when her
   health data is accessed by a healthcare enterprise that is not already
   trusted by the patient. Such awareness is ensured even when some systems
   in the health information sharing environment become compromised. We
   enhance accountability support within eHealth Exchange by using
   digitally signed logs of sharing records that cannot be modified or
   refuted. We implement and evaluate these mechanisms in the open-source
   CONNECT system that follows the eHealth Exchange specifications.}},

Abstract = {{Recently various electronic financial services are provided by
   development of electronic devices and communication technology. By
   diversified electronic financial services and channels, users of none
   face-to-face electronic financial transaction services continuously
   increase. At the same time, under financial security environment,
   leakage threats of inside information and security threats against
   financial transaction users steadily increase. Accordingly, in this
   paper, based on framework standards of financial transaction detection
   and response, digital forensics techniques that has been used to analyze
   system intrusion incidents traditionally is used to detect anomaly
   transactions that may occur in the user terminal environment during
   electronic financial transactions. Particularly, for the method to
   analyze user terminals, automated malware forensics techniques that is
   used as supporting tool for malware code detection and analysis is used,
   and for the method to detect anomaly prior behaviors and transaction
   patterns of users, moving average based on the statistical basis is
   applied. In addition, the risk point calculation model is proposed by
   scoring anomaly transaction cases in the detection step by items. This
   model logs calculated risk point results as well as maintains incident
   accountability, which can be utilized as basic data for establishing
   security incident response and security policies.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of FROST-three
   new forensic tools for the OpenStack cloud platform. Our implementation
   for the OpenStack cloud platform supports an Infrastructure-as-a-Service
   (IaaS) cloud and provides trustworthy forensic acquisition of virtual
   disks, API logs, and guest firewall logs. Unlike traditional acquisition
   tools, FROST works at the cloud management plane rather than interacting
   with the operating system inside the guest virtual machines, thereby
   requiring no trust in the guest machine. We assume trust in the cloud
   provider, but FROST overcomes non-trivial challenges of remote evidence
   integrity by storing log data in hash trees and returning evidence with
   cryptographic hashes. Our tools are user-driven, allowing customers,
   forensic examiners, and law enforcement to conduct investigations
   without necessitating interaction with the cloud provider. We
   demonstrate how FROST's new features enable forensic investigators to
   obtain forensically-sound data from OpenStack clouds independent of
   provider interaction. Our preliminary evaluation indicates the ability
   of our approach to scale in a dynamic cloud environment. The design
   supports an extensible set of forensic objectives, including the future
   addition of other data preservation, discovery, real-time monitoring,
   metrics, auditing, and acquisition capabilities. (C) 2013 Josiah Dykstra

Abstract = {{Objective: To report the results of a systematic literature review
   concerning the security and privacy of electronic health record (EHR)
   systems.
   Data sources: Original articles written in English found in MEDLINE, ACM
   Digital Library, Wiley Inter-Science, IEEE Digital Library,
   Science@Direct, MetaPress, ERIC, CINAHL and Trip Database.
   Study selection: Only those articles dealing with the security and
   privacy of EHR systems.
   Data extraction: The extraction of 775 articles using a predefined
   search string, the outcome of which was reviewed by three authors and
   checked by a fourth.
   Results: A total of 49 articles were selected, of which 26 used
   standards or regulations related to the privacy and security of EHR
   data. The most widely used regulations are the Health Insurance
   Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European Data
   Protection Directive 95/46/EC. We found 23 articles that used symmetric
   key and/or asymmetric key schemes and 13 articles that employed the
   pseudo anonymity technique in EHR systems. A total of 11 articles
   propose the use of a digital signature scheme based on PKI (Public Key
   Infrastructure) and 13 articles propose a login/password (seven of them
   combined with a digital certificate or PIN) for authentication. The
   preferred access control model appears to be Role-Based Access Control
   (RBAC), since it is used in 27 studies. Ten of these studies discuss who
   should define the EHR systems' roles. Eleven studies discuss who should
   provide access to EHR data: patients or health entities. Sixteen of the
   articles reviewed indicate that it is necessary to override defined
   access policies in the case of an emergency. In 25 articles an audit-log
   of the system is produced. Only four studies mention that system users
   and/or health staff should be trained in security and privacy.
   Conclusions: Recent years have witnessed the design of standards and the
   promulgation of directives concerning security and privacy in EHR
   systems. However, more work should be done to adopt these regulations
   and to deploy secure EHR systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Access policy violations by organizational insiders are a major security
   concern for organizations because these violations commonly result in

   current approaches to curbing access policy violations are insufficient.
   This study presents a new approach for reducing access policy
   violations, introducing both the theory of accountability and the
   factorial survey to the information systems field. We identify four
   system mechanisms that heighten an individual's perception of
   accountability: identifiability, awareness of logging, awareness of
   audit, and electronic presence. These accountability mechanisms
   substantially reduce intentions to commit access policy violations.
   These results not only point to several avenues for future research on
   access policy violations but also suggest highly practical
   design-artifact solutions that can be easily implemented with minimal
   impact on organizational insiders.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Since the inception of Web 2.0, instant messaging, e-mailing, and social
   networking have emerged as cheap and efficient means of communication
   over the Web. As a result, a number of communication platforms like
   Digsby have been developed by various research groups to facilitate
   access to multiple e-mail, instant messaging, and social networking
   sites using a single credential. Although such platforms are
   advantageous for end-users, they present new challenges to digital
   forensic examiners because of their illegitimate use by anti-social
   elements. To identify digital artifacts from Digsby log data, an
   examiner is assumed to have knowledge of the whereabouts of Digsby
   traces before starting an investigation process. This paper proposes a
   design for a user-friendly GUI-based forensic tool, DigLA, which
   provides a unified platform for analyzing Digsby log data at different
   levels of granularity. DigLA is also equipped with password decryption
   methods for both machine-specific and portable installation versions of
   Digsby. By considering Windows registry and Digsby log files as dynamic
   sources of evidence, specifically when Digsby has been used to commit a
   cyber crime, this paper presents a systematic approach to analyzing
   Digsby log data. It also presents an approach to analyzing RAM and swap
   files to collect relevant traces, specifically the login credentials of
   Digsby and IM users. An expected insider attack from a server security
   perspective is also studied and discussed in this paper. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The inability to effectively track data in cloud computing environments
   is becoming one of the top concerns for cloud stakeholders. This
   inability is due to two main reasons. Firstly, the lack of data tracking
   tools built for clouds. Secondly, current logging mechanisms are only
   designed from a system-centric perspective. There is a need for
   data-centric logging techniques which can trace data activities (e. g.
   file creation, edition, duplication, transfers, deletions, etc.) within
   and across all cloud servers. This will effectively enable full
   transparency and accountability for data movements in the cloud. In this
   paper, we introduce S2Logger, a data event logging mechanism which
   captures, analyses and visualizes data events in the cloud from the data
   point of view. By linking together atomic data events captured at both
   file and block level, the resulting sequence of data events depicts the
   cloud data provenance records throughout the data lifecycle. With this
   information, we can then detect critical data-related cloud security
   problems such as malicious actions, data leakages and data policy
   violations by analysing the data provenance. S2Logger also enables us to
   address the gaps and inadequacies of existing system-centric security
   tools.}},

Abstract = {{Digital forensics has become a prevalent force in the field of computer
   security; aiding in determining events that may or may not have taken
   place. Academia has taught computer forensics students that one of the
   most important elements of the digital forensic process is having a
   working copy of the original device. Though this concept works well with
   computers and laptops, it does not with smartphones. At this point, a
   bit-for-bit image of a smartphone cannot be made. Furthermore, any
   action taken on a smartphone is logged and therefore, attempting to
   create a copy would in essence change the state of the device; making
   the use of hashes null and void. In an effort to realize interesting and
   unique forensic patterns in the operations of smartphones, two
   experiments were designed using XRY, DiffMerge, and four smartphone
   devices: RIM Blackberry 8703e, Blackberry 7103, Blackberry 8530, and
   Symbian HTC TouchPro 6850. These experiments allowed the researchers to
   compare and contrast the four smartphones not only by the specific
   device but by carrier, manufacturer, file size by category, file size by
   test, and folder size in terms of how the kernel deals with file stores,
   edits, and deletes after specific user operations. The outcome of the
   experiments resulted in a process that helps the forensic examiner to
   manually inspect a device while being aware of the path of contamination
   introduced to the device through user functions. The goal of this
   research is to create an open debate in the forensic community about the
   consideration of different standards when examining smartphones, one of
   which would be the acceptance of change.}},

Abstract = {{Provenance plays a pivotal in tracing the origin of something and
   determining how and why something had occurred. With the emergence of
   the cloud and the benefits it encompasses, there has been a rapid
   proliferation of services being adopted by commercial and government
   sectors. However, trust and security concerns for such services are on
   an unprecedented scale. Currently, these services expose very little
   internal working to their customers; this can cause accountability and
   compliance issues especially in the event of a fault or error, customers
   and providers are left to point finger at each other. Provenance-based
   traceability provides a mean to address part of this problem by being
   able to capture and query events occurred in the past to understand how
   and why it took place. However, due to the complexity of the cloud
   infrastructure, the current provenance models lack the expressibility
   required to describe the inner-working of a cloud service. For a
   complete solution, a provenance-aware policy language is also required
   for operators and users to define policies for compliance purpose. The
   current policy standards do not cater for such requirement.
   To address these issues, in this paper we propose a provenance
   (traceability) model cProv, and a provenance-aware policy language
   (cProvl) to capture traceability data, and express policies for
   validating against the model. For implementation, we have extended the
   XACML3.0 architecture to support provenance, and provided a translator
   that converts cProvl policy and request into XACML type.}},

Abstract = {{Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) consists of a cloud-based
   infrastructure to offer consumers raw computation resources such as
   storage and networking. These resources are billed using a pay-per-use
   cost model. However, this type of infrastructure is far from being a
   security haven as the seven main threats defined by the Cloud Security
   Alliance (CSA) indicate. Using logging systems can provide evidence to
   support accountability for an IaaS cloud, which helps us mitigating
   known threats. In this paper, we research to which extent such logging
   systems help mitigate risks associated with the threats identified by
   the CSA. A generic architecture `template' for logging systems is
   proposed. This template encompasses all possible instantiations of
   logging solutions for IaaS cloud. We map existing logging systems to our
   generic template, and identify a logging solution to mitigate the risks
   associated with CSA threat number one (related to spam activities). We
   then argue that the template we suggest can be used to perform a
   systematic analysis of logging systems in terms of security before
   deploying them in production systems.}},

Abstract = {{Accountability is a requirement to be included in the initial design
   phase of systems because of its strong impact on log architecture
   implementation. As an illustration, the logs we examine here record
   actions by data controllers handling personally identifiable information
   to deliver services to data subjects. The structures of those logs
   seldom consider requirements for accountability, preventing effective
   dispute resolution. We address the question of what information should
   be included in logs to make their a posteriori compliance analysis
   meaningful. Real-world scenarios are used to show that decisions about
   log architecture are nontrivial and should be made from the design stage
   on. Four categories of situations for which straightforward solutions
   are problematic are presented. Our contribution shows how log content
   choices and accountability definitions mutually affect each other and
   incites service providers to rethink up to what extent they can be held
   responsible. These different aspects are synthesized into key guidelines
   to avoid common pitfalls in accountable log design. This analysis is
   based on case studies performed on our implementation of the PPL policy
   language.}},

Abstract = {{These days, sensitive and personal information is used within a wide
   range of applications. The exchange of this information is increasingly
   faster and more and more unpredictable. Hence, the person concerned
   cannot determine what happens with his personal data after it has been
   released. It is highly intransparent who is accountable for data misuse.
   Usage control and provenance tracking are two different approaches to
   tackle this problem. This work compares the two concepts from a data
   protection perspective. The support and fulfillment of data protection
   requirements are analysed. Models and architectures are investigated for
   commonalities. Combining the two technologies can increase flexibility
   and effectiveness of provenance tracking and thereby enhance information
   accountability in practice, if resulting linkability drawbacks are
   properly handled. A joint architecture is proposed to support this
   insight.}},

Abstract = {{In today's technology, new attacks are emerging day by day which makes
   the systems insecure even the system wrapped with number of security
   measures. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is used to detect the
   intrusion. Its prime function is to detect the intrusion and respond in
   timely manner. In other words, IDS function is limited to detection as
   well as response. The IDS is unable to capture the state of the system
   when an intrusion is detected. Hence, it fails to preserve the evidences
   against the attack in original form. To maintain the completeness and
   reliability of evidence for later examination, new security strategy is
   very much needed. In this research work, automated Digital Forensic
   Technique with Intrusion Detection System is proposed. Once an IDS
   detects an intrusion, it sends an alert message to administrator
   followed by invoke the digital forensic tool to capture the state of the
   system. Captured image can be used as evidence in the court of law to
   prove the damage.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is getting more and more attention from the information
   and communication technologies industry recently. Almost all the leading
   companies of the information area show their interesting and efforts on
   cloud computing and release services about cloud computing in
   succession. But if want to make it go further, we should pay more effort
   on security issues. Especially, the Internet environment now has become
   more and more unsecure. With the popularization of computers and
   intelligent devices, the number of crime on them has increased rapidly
   in last decades, and will be quicker on the cloud computing environment
   in future. No wall is wall in the world. We should enhance the cloud
   computing not only at the aspect of precaution, but also at the aspect
   of dealing with the security events to defend it from crime activities.
   In this paper, I propose a approach which using logs model to building a
   forensic-friendly system. Using this model we can quickly gather
   information from cloud computing for some kinds of forensic purpose. And
   this will decrease the complexity of those kinds of forensics.}},

Abstract = {{Trustworthy system logs and application logs are crucial for digital
   forensics. Researchers have proposed different security mechanisms to
   ensure the integrity and confidentiality of logs. However, applying
   current secure logging schemes on heterogeneous formats of logs is
   tedious. Here, we propose FAL, a domain-specific language (DSL) through
   which we can apply a secure logging mechanism on any format of logs.
   Using FAL, we can define log structure, which represents the format of
   logs and ensures the security properties of a chosen secure logging
   scheme. This log structure can be later used by FAL to serve two
   purposes: it can be used to store system logs securely, and it will help
   application developers for secure application logging by generating
   required source code.}},

Abstract = {{Today's cloud services process data and let it often unclear to
   customers, how and by whom data is collected, stored and processed. This
   hinders the adoption of cloud computing by businesses. One way to
   address this problem is to make clouds more accountable, which has to be
   provable by third parties through audits. In this paper we present a
   cloud-adopted evidence collection process, possible evidence sources and
   discuss privacy issues in the context of audits. We introduce an agent
   based architecture, which is able to perform audit processing and
   reporting continuously. Agents can be specialized to perform specific
   audit tasks (e.g., log data analysis) whenever necessary, to reduce
   complexity and the amount of collected evidence information. Finally, a
   multi-provider scenario is discussed, which shows the usefulness of this
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud is a host based network service on the basis of service over
   internet. When large number of users shares the applications for
   uploading, downloading and access control, then there will be hazard of
   fraud access in the network. If accountability is improved, then due to
   some accountability constraint, system performance reduces. Here we
   propose the Push Pull key matching algorithm which performs
   accountability and also improves the performance of system by 56\% than
   existing system. The cloud accountability framework is designed which
   consist of registration manager, log manager and actual application.
   Registration manager performs the service level agreement which is done
   by cloud service provider. When cloud service provider registers, then
   he gets the key of UID and IP address. Accordingly the log manager built
   a key and Push this key securely by encryption process. In encryption
   process, temporal attribute base encryption and advanced encryption
   standard is used for security purpose. The application filter is used to
   performing access role of the system. These roles are assigned by cloud
   service provider after completing service level agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Transparency and confident towards cloud provider are some of the
   prominent issues in cloud today. In order to solve these problems, cloud
   service providers should have a high level of assurance and
   accountability in order to maintain trust between them and the users.
   This trust can be achieved through data provenance. Data provenance
   provides historical data from its original resources and can facilitate
   trust between cloud providers and users. This paper discusses the
   overview of data provenance in cloud computing and significant approach
   in provenance logging system. This is then followed by discussion of
   provenance challenges in cloud environment. Finally, this paper propose
   a novel data provenance trusted model to provide secured access to data
   provenance via a secured communication channel. This model also propose
   a consolidation log storage for virtual and physical layer in cloud
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter concerns security controls (or security measures). Most
   security controls are generic, not country dependent. The
   country-specific part of the topic relates to the government bodies
   responsible for suggesting controls and monitoring adherence to them in
   individual countries. The chapter covers: types of security control -
   classifying them and determining how the controls to be adopted relate
   to different forms of sharing; the stages in deciding what security
   control is appropriate - identifying antecedents, and developing the
   motivation that prompts parties to adopt security controls; calculation
   of the cost-benefits of the security measures; and how security data
   should be logged and evaluated. Other issues, such as the process by
   which citizens are encouraged to adopt the acceptable usage policy, have
   been omitted for lack of space. Finally, the chapter looks at the
   government departments that have a role in security.}},

Abstract = {{Existing work on digital forensics timeline generation focuses on
   extracting times from a disk image into a timeline. Such an approach can
   produce several million `low-level' events (e.g. a file modification or
   a Registry key update) for a single disk. This paper proposes a
   technique that can automatically reconstruct high-level events (e.g.
   connection of a USB stick) from this set of low-level events. The paper
   describes a framework that extracts low-level events to a SQLite backing
   store which is automatically analysed for patterns. The provenance of
   any high-level events is also preserved, meaning that from a high-level
   event it is possible to determine the low-level events that caused its
   inference, and from those, the raw data that caused the low-level event
   to be initially created can also be viewed. The paper also shows how
   such high-level events can be visualised using existing tools. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Logging information about the activities that placed in a computer is
   essential for understanding its behavior. In Homeland Security, the
   reliability of the computers used in their activities is of paramount
   importance. However, attackers can delete logs to hide evidence of their
   activities. Additionally, various problems may result in logs being
   lost. These problems decrease the dependability of Homeland Security. To
   address these problems, we previously proposed a secure logging scheme
   using a virtual machine monitor (VMM). The scheme collects logs and
   isolates them from the monitored OS. However, the scheme cannot store
   them automatically. Thus, logs in memory are lost when the computer is
   shutdown. Further, if the logs are not stored, it is impossible to
   detect incidents of tampering by comparing the logs of the monitored OS
   with those of the logging OS. To address these additional problems, this
   paper proposes a log-storing module and a tamper detection scheme. The
   log-storing module automatically stores logs collected by the logging
   module, and tamper detection is realized by comparing these stored log
   files with those of the monitored OS. We implemented the log-storing
   module and realized the tamper detection scheme. Evaluations reveal the
   effectiveness of the tamper detection scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Audit logs are an integral part of modern computer systems due to their
   forensic value. Protecting audit logs on a physically unprotected
   machine in hostile environments is a challenging task, especially in the
   presence of active adversaries. It is critical for such a system to have
   forward security and append-only properties such that when an adversary
   compromises a logging machine, she cannot forge or selectively delete
   the log entries accumulated before the compromise. Existing
   public-key-based secure logging schemes are computationally costly.
   Existing symmetric secure logging schemes are not publicly verifiable
   and open to certain attacks.
   In this article, we develop a new forward-secure and aggregate signature
   scheme called Blind-Aggregate-Forward (BAF), which is suitable for
   secure logging in resource-constrained systems. BAF is the only
   cryptographic secure logging scheme that can produce publicly
   verifiable, forward-secure and aggregate signatures with low
   computation, key/signature storage, and signature communication
   overheads for the loggers, without requiring any online trusted third
   party support. A simple variant of BAF also allows a fine-grained
   verification of log entries without compromising the security or
   computational efficiency of BAF. We prove that our schemes are secure in
   Random Oracle Model (ROM). We also show that they are significantly more
   efficient than all the previous publicly verifiable cryptographic secure
   logging schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed
   over the Internet on an as-needed basis. A major feature of the cloud
   services is that users' data are usually processed remotely in unknown
   machines that users do not own or operate. While enjoying the
   convenience brought by this new emerging technology, users' fears of
   losing control of their own data (particularly, financial and health
   data) can become a significant barrier to the wide adoption of cloud
   services. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel
   highly decentralized information accountability framework to keep track
   of the actual usage of the users' data in the cloud. In particular, we
   propose an object-centered approach that enables enclosing our logging
   mechanism together with users' data and policies. We leverage the JAR
   programmable capabilities to both create a dynamic and traveling object,
   and to ensure that any access to users' data will trigger authentication
   and automated logging local to the JARs. To strengthen user's control,
   we also provide distributed auditing mechanisms. We provide extensive
   experimental studies that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness
   of the proposed approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The Identity-Based Internet Protocol (IBIP) Network project is
   experimenting with a new enterprise oriented network architecture using
   standard Internet Protocol to encode identity (ID) information into the
   IP packet by a new edge security device referred to as the IBIP policy
   enforcement point (PEP). This is a variant of a network admission
   control process that establishes user and host identities as well as
   provides optional information on host visibility, organizational
   affiliation, current role, and trust metric (associated with the user
   and host endpoints). Our motivation is to increase our security posture
   by leveraging identity, reducing our threat exposure, enhancing
   situational understanding of our environment, and simplifying network
   operations. In addition to authentication, we leverage strong
   anti-spoofing technology to improve accountability. We reduce our threat
   surface by ``hiding{''} our client hosts and making all infrastructure
   devices inaccessible. Any attempt to access a hidden host or
   infrastructure device results in a policy violation attributable to the
   user/host that caused the violation and provides enhanced situational
   awareness of such activities. Our servers can also have a ``permissible
   use{''} policy that ensures that the server only operates across the
   network per that policy. Finally, as users log in and servers are added
   to the network, all dynamic configurations for access control initiated
   by such changes are automatically carried out without manual
   intervention, thereby reducing potential vulnerabilities caused by human
   errors.}},

Abstract = {{Accountability is a very important topic for computer and networking
   systems. It helps to answer questions such as, What happened? and, Who
   did it? These two questions are also related to forensics; however,
   forensics normally tries to answer these questions by adding some human
   factors (such as a guess or an instinct due to missing evidence, as well
   as human involvements) under the available system. Accountability, on
   the other hand, can only be achieved by significantly improving the
   current system with the result that forensics becomes trivial in an
   accountable system. Furthermore, each entity in the system must be held
   responsible for its activities. In order to provide accountability, a
   better logging system is necessary so that not only their activities but
   also their relationships may be captured. To this end, our previous work
   proposed a novel logging mechanism, flow-net methodology, for
   accountability. In this paper, we extend the flow-net methodology and
   present its design and implementation in wireless networks. We also
   evaluate the performance of flow-net and compare it with that of audit
   log files. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Provenance is an increasing concern due to the revolution in sharing and
   processing scientific data on the Web and in other computer systems. It
   is proposed that many computer systems will need to become
   provenance-aware in order to provide satisfactory accountability,
   reproducibility, and trust for scientific or other high-value data. To
   date, there is not a consensus concerning appropriate formal models or
   security properties for provenance. In previous work, we introduced a
   formal framework for provenance security and proposed formal definitions
   of properties called disclosure and obfuscation.
   This paper develops a core calculus for provenance in programming
   languages. Whereas previous models of provenance have focused on
   special-purpose languages such as workflows and database queries, we
   consider a higher-order, functional language with sums, products, and
   recursive types and functions. We explore the ramifications of using
   traces based on operational derivations for the purpose of comparing
   other forms of provenance. We design a rich class of provenance views
   over traces. Finally, we prove relationships among provenance views and
   develop some solutions to the disclosure and obfuscation problems.}},
