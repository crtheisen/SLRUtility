Abstract = {{IP address of a device, from where an offending activity was performed,
   is of limited value, because it does not specify a physical device/user,
   but an endpoint in network. It is useful to have information about where
   a device/user was at the time the offending activity was performed. It
   would be desirable to correlate different pieces of evidence to discover
   information, such as IP addresses used by the same device, physical
   address and location of the device, connection time of the device,
   browsing habits and mail access transactions carried out by the user
   using the device. Log data from various sources are required to be
   correlated together to create contexts of information, which is not
   visible from one source alone. In large networks, users/devices
   accessing a private network repeatedly can be tracked by analyzing and
   correlating DHCP, Network Access Control, WWW, Email server logs. With
   huge amount of logs, the common approach of manual browsing, correlating
   of log events, based on timelines is tedious, unresponsive approach.
   Flat file based sequential search system is not responsive, hence RDBMS
   based tracking systems are desirable. To build a responsive system
   requires identifying, consolidating log files, conversion, transmission
   and storage into relational databases. An automated system has been
   developed at our organization for forensic analysis of network accesses,
   with device and user tracking as its goal. We present, our approach to
   perform log management, correlation, which assists in performing
   responsive forensic analysis of real network with more than 2500 nodes,
   aimed at tracking users/devices.}},

Abstract = {{With the spectacular increase in online activities like e-transactions,
   security and privacy issues are at the peak with respect to their
   significance. Large numbers of database security breaches are occurring
   at a very high rate on daily basis. So, there is a crucial need in the
   field of database forensics to make several redundant copies of
   sensitive data found in database server artifacts, audit logs, cache,
   table storage etc. for analysis purposes. Large volume of metadata is
   available in database infrastructure for investigation purposes but most
   of the effort lies in the retrieval and analysis of that information
   from computing systems. Thus, in this paper we mainly focus on the
   significance of metadata in database forensics. We proposed a system
   here to perform forensics analysis of database by generating its
   metadata file independent of the DBMS system used. We also aim to
   generate the digital evidence against criminals for presenting it in the
   court of law in the form of who, when, why, what, how and where did the
   fraudulent transaction occur. Thus, we are presenting a system to detect
   major database attacks as well as anti-forensics attacks by developing
   an open source database forensics tool. Eventually, we are pointing out
   the challenges in the field of forensics and how these challenges can be
   used as opportunities to stimulate the areas of database forensics.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To report the results of a systematic literature review
   concerning the security and privacy of electronic health record (EHR)
   systems.
   Data sources: Original articles written in English found in MEDLINE, ACM
   Digital Library, Wiley Inter-Science, IEEE Digital Library,
   Science@Direct, MetaPress, ERIC, CINAHL and Trip Database.
   Study selection: Only those articles dealing with the security and
   privacy of EHR systems.
   Data extraction: The extraction of 775 articles using a predefined
   search string, the outcome of which was reviewed by three authors and
   checked by a fourth.
   Results: A total of 49 articles were selected, of which 26 used
   standards or regulations related to the privacy and security of EHR
   data. The most widely used regulations are the Health Insurance
   Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European Data
   Protection Directive 95/46/EC. We found 23 articles that used symmetric
   key and/or asymmetric key schemes and 13 articles that employed the
   pseudo anonymity technique in EHR systems. A total of 11 articles
   propose the use of a digital signature scheme based on PKI (Public Key
   Infrastructure) and 13 articles propose a login/password (seven of them
   combined with a digital certificate or PIN) for authentication. The
   preferred access control model appears to be Role-Based Access Control
   (RBAC), since it is used in 27 studies. Ten of these studies discuss who
   should define the EHR systems' roles. Eleven studies discuss who should
   provide access to EHR data: patients or health entities. Sixteen of the
   articles reviewed indicate that it is necessary to override defined
   access policies in the case of an emergency. In 25 articles an audit-log
   of the system is produced. Only four studies mention that system users
   and/or health staff should be trained in security and privacy.
   Conclusions: Recent years have witnessed the design of standards and the
   promulgation of directives concerning security and privacy in EHR
   systems. However, more work should be done to adopt these regulations
   and to deploy secure EHR systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Since the inception of Web 2.0, instant messaging, e-mailing, and social
   networking have emerged as cheap and efficient means of communication
   over the Web. As a result, a number of communication platforms like
   Digsby have been developed by various research groups to facilitate
   access to multiple e-mail, instant messaging, and social networking
   sites using a single credential. Although such platforms are
   advantageous for end-users, they present new challenges to digital
   forensic examiners because of their illegitimate use by anti-social
   elements. To identify digital artifacts from Digsby log data, an
   examiner is assumed to have knowledge of the whereabouts of Digsby
   traces before starting an investigation process. This paper proposes a
   design for a user-friendly GUI-based forensic tool, DigLA, which
   provides a unified platform for analyzing Digsby log data at different
   levels of granularity. DigLA is also equipped with password decryption
   methods for both machine-specific and portable installation versions of
   Digsby. By considering Windows registry and Digsby log files as dynamic
   sources of evidence, specifically when Digsby has been used to commit a
   cyber crime, this paper presents a systematic approach to analyzing
   Digsby log data. It also presents an approach to analyzing RAM and swap
   files to collect relevant traces, specifically the login credentials of
   Digsby and IM users. An expected insider attack from a server security
   perspective is also studied and discussed in this paper. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The inability to effectively track data in cloud computing environments
   is becoming one of the top concerns for cloud stakeholders. This
   inability is due to two main reasons. Firstly, the lack of data tracking
   tools built for clouds. Secondly, current logging mechanisms are only
   designed from a system-centric perspective. There is a need for
   data-centric logging techniques which can trace data activities (e. g.
   file creation, edition, duplication, transfers, deletions, etc.) within
   and across all cloud servers. This will effectively enable full
   transparency and accountability for data movements in the cloud. In this
   paper, we introduce S2Logger, a data event logging mechanism which
   captures, analyses and visualizes data events in the cloud from the data
   point of view. By linking together atomic data events captured at both
   file and block level, the resulting sequence of data events depicts the
   cloud data provenance records throughout the data lifecycle. With this
   information, we can then detect critical data-related cloud security
   problems such as malicious actions, data leakages and data policy
   violations by analysing the data provenance. S2Logger also enables us to
   address the gaps and inadequacies of existing system-centric security
   tools.}},

Abstract = {{Forensic analysis of software log files is used to extract user behavior
   profiles, detect fraud, and check compliance with policies and
   regulations. Software systems maintain several types of log files for
   different purposes. For example, a system may maintain logs for
   debugging, monitoring application performance, and/or tracking user
   access to system resources. The objective of my research is to develop
   and validate a minimum set of log file attributes and software security
   metrics for user nonrepudiation by measuring the degree to which a given
   audit log file captures the data necessary to allow for meaningful
   forensic analysis of user behavior within the software system. For a log
   to enable user nonrepudiation, the log file must record certain data
   fields, such as a unique user identifier. The log must also record
   relevant user activity, such as creating, viewing, updating, and
   deleting system resources, as well as software security events, such as
   the addition or revocation of user privileges. Using a grounded theory
   method, I propose a methodology for observing the current state of
   activity logging mechanisms in healthcare, education, and finance, then
   I quantify differences between activity logs and logs not specifically
   intended to capture user activity. I will then propose software security
   metrics for quantifying the forensic-ability of log files. I will
   evaluate my work with empirical analysis by comparing the performance of
   my metrics on several types of log files, including both activity logs
   and logs not directly intended to record user activity. My research will
   help software developers strengthen user activity logs for facilitating
   forensic analysis for user nonrepudiation.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed denials of service (DDoS) attacks are recognized as one of
   the most damaging attacks on the Internet security today. Recently,
   malicious web crawlers have been used to execute automated DDoS attacks
   on web sites across the WWW. In this study, we examine the use of two
   unsupervised neural network (NN) learning algorithms for the purpose
   web-log analysis: the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Modified Adaptive
   Resonance Theory 2 (Modified ART2). In particular, through the use of
   SOM and modified ART2, our work aims to obtain a better insight into the
   types and distribution of visitors to a public web-site based on their
   browsing behavior, as well as to investigate the relative differences
   and/or similarities between malicious web crawlers and other
   non-malicious visitor groups. The results of our study show that, even
   though there is a pretty clear separation between malicious web-crawlers
   and other visitor groups, 52\% of malicious crawlers exhibit very
   `human-like' browsing behavior and as such pose a particular challenge
   for future web-site security systems. Also, we show that some of the
   feature values of malicious crawlers that exhibit very `human-like'
   browsing behavior are not significantly different than the features
   values of human visitors. Additionally, we show that Google, MSN and
   Yahoo crawlers exhibit distinct crawling behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.

Abstract = {{Forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify
   suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to
   form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability
   to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past
   two decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed
   information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to
   improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that
   transparently monitors and records data access events within a
   virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the
   hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and
   follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after
   the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these
   transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for
   faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the
   changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we
   provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case
   study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable
   information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been
   detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking
   mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple
   disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.}},

Abstract = {{Audit logs are an integral part of modern computer systems due to their
   forensic value. Protecting audit logs on a physically unprotected
   machine in hostile environments is a challenging task, especially in the
   presence of active adversaries. It is critical for such a system to have
   forward security and append-only properties such that when an adversary
   compromises a logging machine, she cannot forge or selectively delete
   the log entries accumulated before the compromise. Existing
   public-key-based secure logging schemes are computationally costly.
   Existing symmetric secure logging schemes are not publicly verifiable
   and open to certain attacks.
   In this article, we develop a new forward-secure and aggregate signature
   scheme called Blind-Aggregate-Forward (BAF), which is suitable for
   secure logging in resource-constrained systems. BAF is the only
   cryptographic secure logging scheme that can produce publicly
   verifiable, forward-secure and aggregate signatures with low
   computation, key/signature storage, and signature communication
   overheads for the loggers, without requiring any online trusted third
   party support. A simple variant of BAF also allows a fine-grained
   verification of log entries without compromising the security or
   computational efficiency of BAF. We prove that our schemes are secure in
   Random Oracle Model (ROM). We also show that they are significantly more
   efficient than all the previous publicly verifiable cryptographic secure
   logging schemes.}},

Abstract = {{In modern computer networks and IT systems, event logging is commonly
   used for collecting system health information, in order to ease the
   system management process. For example, many sites are collecting events
   and network flow records from their applications, servers, and network
   devices over protocols like syslog, SNMP and Netflow, and analyze these
   data at central monitoring server(s). Among collected data, many events
   and records provide information about security incidents. Unfortunately,
   during the last decade security logs have grown rapidly in size, making
   the manual analysis extremely labor intensive task. This task is further
   complicated by the large number of irrelevant records and false positive
   alerts in security logs. For this reason, the development of methods for
   detecting important events and knowledge from security logs has become a
   key research issue during the recent years. In our paper, we propose
   some methods for tackling this issue in the context of IDS and Netflow
   logs from an organizational network. The first contribution of this
   paper is the study of important properties of IDS and Netflow logs. We
   have conducted our analysis on a number of production system logs
   obtained from a large financial institution, and some of our findings
   are supported by results from other researchers. The second contribution
   of the paper is the proposal of several data mining based and heuristic
   methods for event and knowledge detection from security logs. Our data
   mining methods are based on frequent itemset mining for identifying
   regularities in IDS alert sets and network traffic. These regularities
   are then used for finding unexpected IDS alert patterns and prominent
   network traffic flows. In this paper, we also discuss the
   implementations of the proposed methods in a production environment, and
   provide performance estimates for our implementations. We conclude the
   paper with a short discussion on some promising directions for further
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of intrusions is a continuing problem in network security. Due
   to the large volumes of data recorded in Web server logs, analysis is
   typically forensic, taking place only after a problem has occurred. This
   paper describes a novel method of representing Web log information
   through multi-channel sound, while simultaneously visualizing network
   activity using a 3 -D immersive environment. We are exploring the
   detection of intrusion signatures and patterns, utilizing human aural
   and visual pattern recognition ability to detect intrusions as they
   occur. IP addresses and return codes are mapped to an informative and
   unobtrusive listening environment to act as a situational sound track of
   Web traffic.
   Web log data is parsed and formatted using Python, then read as a data
   array by the synthesis language SuperCollider {[}1], which renders it as
   a sonification. This can be done either for the study of pre-existing
   data sets or in monitoring Web traffic in real time. Components rendered
   aurally include IP address, geographical information, and server Return
   Codes. Users can interact with the data, speeding or slowing the speed
   of representation (for pre-existing data sets) or ``mixing{''} sound

Abstract = {{Network Intrusion Detection Systems are used in network forensics and
   network auditing to log suspicious activities that potentially signify
   security violations on the networks as alerts. However, the efficacies
   of intrusion aggregations to succinctly process audit logs that are
   gaining wider acceptability in computer security are flawed because the
   methods frequently require high level of expertise to validate each
   alert and the methods only focus on interesting events. Thus, deceptive
   attacks that are intentionally launched to be uninteresting events
   frequently elude detections. Consequently, aggregated alerts are not
   seriously considered for litigation and incident handling exercises.
   Therefore, this paper presents extensive investigations of these
   problems. We deployed Snort to sniff offline datasets in intrusion
   detection mode and we clustered the alerts of each dataset with several
   filtering criteria. Furthermore, the results obtained have established
   how to detect various kinds of interesting and uninteresting attacks
   that frequently elude detections.}},

Abstract = {{Audit logs, providing information about the current and past states of
   systems, are one of the most important parts of modem computer systems.
   Providing security for audit logs on an untrusted machine in a large
   distributed system is a challenging task, especially in the presence of
   active adversaries. In such a system, it is critical to have forward
   security such that when an adversary compromises a machine, she cannot
   modify or forge the log entries accumulated before the compromise.
   Unfortunately, existing secure audit logging schemes have significant
   limitations that make them impractical for real-life applications:
   Existing Public Key Cryptography (PKC) based schemes are computationally
   expensive for logging in task intensive or resource-constrained systems,
   while existing symmetric schemes are not publicly verifiable and incur
   significant storage and communication overheads.
   In this paper, we propose a novel forward secure and aggregate logging
   scheme called Blind-Aggregate-Forward (BAF) logging scheme, which is
   suitable for large distributed systems. BAF can produce publicly
   verifiable forward secure and aggregate signatures with near-zero
   computational, storage, and communication costs for the loggers, without
   requiring any online Trusted Third Party (TTP) support. We prove that
   BAF is secure under appropriate computational assumptions, and
   demonstrate that BAF is significantly more efficient and scalable than
   the previous schemes. Therefore, BAF is an ideal solution for secure
   logging in both task intensive and resource-constrained systems.}},

Abstract = {{Logs record the events that have happened within in a system so they are
   considered the history of system activities. They axe one of the objects
   that digital forensic investigators would like to examine when a
   security incident happens. However, logs were initially created for
   trouble shooting, and are not purposefully designed for digital
   forensics. Thus, enormous and redundant log data make analysis tasks
   complicated and time-consuming to find valuable information, and make
   logging-related techniques difficult utilized in some systems such as
   embedded systems. In this paper, we reconsider a data logging mechanism
   in terms of forensics and consequently, we propose purpose-based
   forensic logging. In purpose-based forensic logging, we only collect the
   required logs according to a specific purpose, which could decrease the
   space that logs occupy and may mitigate the analysis tasks during
   forensic investigations.}},

Abstract = {{With the growth of communication networks, event logs are increasing in
   size at a fast rate. Today, it is not uncommon to have systems that
   generate tens of gigabytes of log data per day. Log data are likely to
   contain information that deserves closer attention - such as security
   events - but the task of reviewing logs manually is beyond the
   capabilities of a human. This paper discusses data mining tools SLCT and
   LogHound that were designed for assisting system management personnel in
   extracting knowledge from event logs.}},

Abstract = {{Digital forensics encompasses the process of identifying the perpetrator
   and the criminal method by analyzing the logs generated in the computer
   Log files record the activities of the computer and by reading them one
   can know what kind of event happened at a certain time. Therefore,
   secure logs with the integrity property are essential. In this paper, we
   discuss two approaches to achieve the integrity of logs- the kernel
   module and virtualization, and compare them. Although virtualization is
   more inefficient in performance than the kernel module, it provides more
   security properties for logs. Thus, we then focus on the virtualization
   approach with a detailed proposal, which describes ways to preserve logs
   without tampering and deletion.}},

Abstract = {{As the amount and types of remote network services increase, the
   analysis of their logs has become a very difficult and time consuming
   task. There are several ways to filter relevant information and provide
   a reduced log set for analysis, such as whitelisting and intrusion
   detection tools, but all of them require too much fine-tuning work and
   human expertise. Nowadays, researchers are evaluating data mining
   approaches for intrusion detection in network logs, using techniques
   such as genetic algorithms, neural networks, clustering algorithms, etc.
   Some of those techniques yield good results, yet requiring a very large
   number of attributes gathered by network traffic to detect useful
   information. In this work we apply and evaluate some data mining
   techniques (K-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Networks and Decision
   Trees) in a reduced number of attributes on some log data sets acquired
   from a real network and a honeypot, in order to classify traffic logs as
   normal or suspicious. The results obtained allow us to identify
   unlabeled logs and to describe which attributes were used for the
   decision. This approach provides a very reduced amount of logs to the
   network administrator, improving the analysis task and aiding in
   discovering new kinds of attacks against their networks.}},

Abstract = {{Compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
   (HIPAA) requires gathering audit information from picture archiving and
   communications systems (PACS) regarding evidence trails of human
   interactions. Until recently, most PACS users have had limited access to
   auditing information. Access required resources to handle manual
   inspection of audit logs, and access to proprietary databases was not
   always available. Some vendors now produce eXtensible Markup Language
   (XML) audit logs based on certain events occurring in PACS. However, it
   is up to the user to convert this information into an easily mined data
   repository supporting compliance and quality control. This process can
   be handled in multiple ways, which could mean different audit mechanisms
   depending on the PACS (or other hospital system) used. It is apparent
   that an organized method of dealing with audit information is needed.
   This help may be provided within the Integrating the Healthcare
   Environment (IHE) framework. The IHE initiative defines a set of
   profiles, actors, and transactions that create common scenarios for
   particular workflow processes. The Integration Profiles depict security
   as a fundamental requirement of the framework. Specifically, the Audit
   Trail and Node Authentication (ATNA) profile defines standards based
   mechanisms for securely transmitting and storing audit records in a
   central repository. The data structure defined by the profile provides a
   number of record types that capture different audit events. A general
   feasibility study for storing currently available PACS audit information
   following the profile is defined, and steps to an automated solution are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA,
   instituted April 2003) Security Standards mandate health institutions to
   protect health information against unauthorized use or disclosure. One
   approach to addressing this mandate is by utilizing user access control
   and generating audit trails of the various authorized as well as
   unauthorized user access of health data. Although most current clinical
   image systems {[}e.g., picture archiving and communication system
   (PACS)] have components that generate log files for application
   debugging purposes, there is a lack of methodology to obtain and
   synthesize the pertinent data from the large volumes of log data
   generated by these multiple components within a PACS. We have designed a
   HIPAA-compliant architecture specifically for tracking and auditing the
   image workflow of clinical imaging systems such as PACS. As an initial
   first step, we developed HIPAA-compliant auditing system (H-CAS) based
   on parts of this HIPAA-compliant architecture. H-CAS was implemented
   within a test-bed PACS simulator located in the Image Processing and
   Informatics lab at the University of Southern California. Evaluation
   scenarios were developed where different user types performed legal and
   illegal access of PACS image data within each of the different
   components in the PACS simulator. Results were based on whether the
   scenarios of unauthorized access were correctly identified and
   documented as well as on normal operational activity. Integration and
   implementation pitfalls were also noted and included.}},

   chains of events in a dependency graph. We use BackTracker to analyze
   several real attacks against computers that we set up as honeypots. In
   each case, BackTracker is able to highlight effectively the entry point
   used to gain access to the system and the sequence of steps from that
   entry point to the point at which we noticed the intrusion. The logging
   required to support BackTracker added 9\% overhead in running time and

   their activities, there is a lack of formal methodology to interpret
   these large volumes of log data and generate HIPAA compliant auditing
   trails. In this paper, we present a HIPAA compliant auditing (HCA)
   toolkit for auditing the image data flow of PACS. The toolkit can
   extract pertinent auditing information from the logs of various PACS
   components and store the information in a centralized auditing database.
   The HIPAA compliant audit trails can be generated based on the database,
   which can also be utilized for data analysis to facilitate the dynamic
   monitoring of the data flow of PACS. In order to demonstrate the HCA
   toolkit in a PACS environment, it was integrated with the PACS
   Simulator, that was presented as an educational tool in 2003 and 2004
   SPIE. With the integration of the HCA toolkit with the PACS simulator,
   users can learn HIPAA audit concepts and how to generate audit trails of
   image data access in PACS, as well as trace the image data flow of PACS
   Simulator through the toolkit.}},

Abstract = {{A new User-Mode Linux based virtual honeynet architecture is presented
   in this paper. The new architecture has improved functionality that is
   difficult to realize in the GenII honeynet. Two new honeynet
   capabilities in particular are introduced. Honeypot controller is a new
   virtual honeynet component that assists in data control. The honeywall
   promises to have finer control over the honeypots through signal and
   system call redirections. The second new capability is the disk imager.
   The disk imager is capable of making forensic images of the virtual
   machine's file systems for further analysis. H
   Since security for virtual honeynets is a big concern, the new virtual
   honeynet architecture utilizes Security Enhanced Linux to isolate the
   untrusted honeypots from the completely trusted honeywall. SELinux and
   other research work done in this field makes the new honeynet
   architecture a viable alternative to GenII honeynets.
   A file system logging mechanism, FSLog, has been developed for the UML
   based virtual honeynet. In conjunction with the built-in tty logger, UML
   based honeynets have logging capabilities that are equivalent to their
   GenII honeynet counterparts. The current version of FSLog successfully
   logs eighteen Virtual File Systems system calls including the common,
   read(), write(), open() and close() functions. Its current functionality
   and how it pieces into the new architecture is also discussed.
   This work provides researchers with an alternative honeynet platform.
   The new virtual honeynet architecture is more portable, easier to setup,
   more cost effective and as secure as the GenII honeynet. The addition of
   the honeypot controller and disk imager components also makes the new
   virtual honeynet architecture more capable.}},

Abstract = {{Due to increase in occurrences of intrusion events, organizations are
   now moving towards implementation of various types of monitoring systems
   to detect and prevent IT security breaches. For that purpose, different
   techniques have been used. Logging is one of such technique. Typical
   enterprise consists of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, operating
   systems, legacy applications etc, where each element uses its own
   conventions and formats of logs. It increases the complexity in
   comprehensive analysis of logs to generate real time alerts and it also
   increases time to conduct forensic analysis. In this paper we have
   presented the concept of application level unification of logs in a
   consistent format at centralized locations to detect and prevent real
   time or near real time intrusions in a cost effective manner.}},

   a service with public is a frequent cause of illegal access. An
   administrator takes on heavy work load in conventional model of service

   application gateway which has functions of single sign-on, user
   authentication and service provisions. We call the application gateway
   service connector. The proposed model can improve security on server
   host and realize centralized user management and access-log analysis,
