AB  - Abstract
The ability to reconstruct the data stored in a database at an earlier time is an important aspect of database forensics. Past research shows that the log file in a database can be useful for reconstruction. However, in many database systems there are various options that control which information is included in the logs. This paper introduces the notion of the ideal log setting necessary for an effective reconstruction process in database forensics. The paper provides a survey of the default logging preferences in some of the popular database management systems and identifies the information that a database log should contain in order to be useful for reconstruction. The challenges that may be encountered in storing the information as well as ways of overcoming the challenges are discussed. Possible logging preferences that may be considered as the ideal log setting for the popular database systems are also proposed. In addition, the paper relates the identified requirements to the three dimensions of reconstruction in database forensics and points out the additional requirements and/or techniques that may be required in the different dimensions.

AB  - Abstract
Today's computer and network systems were not originally designed for accountability which plays a crucial role in information assurance systems. To assure accountability, each entity in the system should be held responsible for its own behaviors so that the entity is part of larger chains of the system's accountability. To achieve accountable logging, a flow-net methodology was proposed in our previous work. Moreover, the multi-layer feature of computer and network systems brings us the chance to achieve multiple degrees of accountability, which means that we are able to acknowledge the system's behaviors at different levels of accountability. To achieve multiple degrees of accountability, we propose designs of a multi-resolution flow-net scheme in this paper and find out the optimal design under different assumptions. Furthermore, we apply the multi-resolution flow-net on TCP/IP networks that are designed and organized with multiple layers. Finally, evaluation results are presented to verify the better performance provided by multi-resolution flow-net than other schemes.

AB  - Abstract
Log management and analysis is a vital part of organization's network management and system administration. Logs indicate current status of the system and contain information that refers to different security events, which occur within the system. Logs are used for different purposes, such as recording user activities, track authentication attempts, and other security events. Due to increasing number of threats against networks and systems, the number of security logs increases. However, many organizations that work in a distributed environment face following problems: log generation and storage, log protection, and log analysis. Moreover, ensuring that security, system and network administrators analyze log data in an effective way is another issue. In this research, we propose an approach for receiving, storing and administrating audit log events. Furthermore, we present a solution design that in a secure way allows organizations in distributed environments to send audit log transactions from different local networks to one centralized server.

AB  - Several operating systems provide a central logging service which collects event messages from the kernel and applications, filters them and writes them into log files. Since more than a decade such a system service exists in Microsoft Windows NT. Its file format is well understood and supported by forensic software. Microsoft Vista introduces an event logging service which entirely got newly designed. This confronts forensic examiners and software authors with unfamiliar system behavior and a new, widely undocumented file format.

This article describes the history of Windows system loggers, what has been changed over time and for what reason. It compares Vista log files in their native binary form and in a textual form. Based on the results, this paper for the first time publicly describes the key-elements of the new log file format and the proprietary binary encoding of XML. It discusses the problems that may arise during daily work. Finally it proposes a procedure for how to recover information from log fragments. During a criminal investigation this procedure was successfully applied to recover information from a corrupted event log.

This chapter provides an introduction to log review, response, and escalation for log management. Examples using Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) will be a running theme throughout this chapter. The idea is to illustrate how to apply the concepts in the real world. This means examples are geared toward PCI standards, but they can easily be adapted and extended to fit any environment. In essence, this chapter develops a set of steps and procedures which you can begin using today. An added side benefit of this chapter is insight into interpreting and applying standards to log management.

AB  - The importance of providing a secure environment for individual and corporate data, research, and communications has grown to critical proportions as more of the mission and business of colleges and universities is carried out over networked information infrastructures. System administrators must implement new, more extensive processes to protect data, to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities, and to find and manage abuses of the systems they manage. They have responded by increasing the network and major systems logging and monitoring efforts and want to do more. But how far can they go before their logging for the sake of security becomes surveillance and a violation of student record privacy under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)? What systems are they logging? How are they managing logs? What training have they had to support their work in the areas of security and data management? What processes are in place to manage log data from unauthorized access?

In 2001, researchers at the University of Michigan, funded by the National Science Foundation, explored these questions. The results of this study raise important questions for security professionals and systems developers. This paper provides information about the sample’s system administrators, designated as logging experts on campuses, about their training in security and information protection. It discusses the types of logging that administrators are doing and the data it yields. The paper raises issues about how far administrators can go before they violate student record privacy law and makes recommendations for needed actions.

AB  - Networks are exposed to an unending series of attacks and exposures. External threats usually come from the Internet and can be grouped into three broad categories such as denial of service (DoS); using the victim's network as a base of attack, to target other networks; or for threat or alteration of information. Internal threats can come from individuals with legitimate access or from those that are exceeding their level of privilege. This means that a forensic expert must understand how the network works and how to access logged data.

AB  - Every computer action registers a log somewhere – giving a rich source of data that can help businesses identify any trace of corruption within their networks. Log collection is also a strong component of keeping in line with legislation such as Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, GLBA in the US, and the European Data Protection Directive in the EU. Mathieu Gorge looks at what logs organizations need to keep and what standards require their storage.

He recommends proactive monitoring of firewalls, anti-virus, VPNs and IDS logs among other security systems. The main goal is to link a transaction back to an individual user in order to perform a forensic investigation. But it is important to be wary, as some countries do not allow companies to monitor staff usage of IT systems. See page 3 on how the European court ruled that a British college's monitoring of one employee was a breach of human rights. Therefore, linking a log with a person's actions may not stand up in court.

Gorge says logs can give as good an insight into external attacks as well as internally driven ones.

Logs should be analyzed for the following:
				•
User account activity: creation, elevation of privilege, changes, inactivity.
•
Client requests and server response.
•
Operational status: shutdown (planned or unplanned), system failure and automatic restart.
•
Usage information and trends – basic user behaviour analysis.


It is best practice to collect, store and analyze logs with a view to being able to get complete, accurate and verifiable information. This will improve the organization's ability to comply with key standards and legislation as regards e-evidence. It could save an organization from potential liability and repair costs and will give visibility over mission critical and security systems, performance and usage. The main advice is to remain proactive so as to be able to respond to a security incident and comply with legal requests should anything happen.

Mathieu Gorge looks at what logs can do for your business and how governance demands them.

AB  - Despite most businesses having a range of devices which create log files of user and system activity, few actually analyse the logs for information.

As the internet becomes an integral part of the way we live and work, the number of logs generated and their importance has continued to increase. More homes now have broadband connections. Most businesses at least have email and many have an interactive web presence, or at the very least a static web ‘brochure’. All of the internet traffic these generate has the capacity to create useful information for marketers, and more importantly for security engineers, in the form of log entries.

AB  - Publisher Summary
The Event Log service tracks the activity of each component in Windows 2000. It handles the logging of events into a single centralized log database. The events that get logged can range from checkpoints, such as a service reporting that it started without errors, to detailed tracking of user activity, and are determined by the programmer of the application in use. Management of the Event Logs is done using Event Viewer snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console. Event Log operations include the viewing, saving, and clearing of Event Log. To keep the Event Logs from growing large enough to take up all available disk space on a server, they must be kept at a manageable size. Security Events can be used to track the actions of user accounts and to determine whether users are snooping around in data they should not be seeing. Security auditing features can also be used by administrators to cover their tracks. Care should be taken and a proper Event Log access and archiving policy should be set up to ensure that all server activity can be recorded and saved for future analysis.

AB  - Although there are several ways to address log collection, the focus in this chapter is on using the Enterprise Security Management (ESM) connector solutions mentioned in Chapter 9. There are many ways to perform log collection, and ESM vendors offer several solutions. As discussed in Chapter 9, logs can be sent directly from point devices to the ESM manager, and they can come from a log collection appliance, a device manager such as a firewall or intrusion detection system manager, logical aggregation points such as syslog servers, or some hybrid of all of these.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the log analysis. The ideas and tools that were shown briefly can help an organization in several ways. The main idea is that the information coming out of all of the security devices across network(s) firewalls, intrusion detection system (IDS)/IPS, and access control lists (ACLs) can be much like torrential rain. However, out of that rain, security organizations are supposed to be able to determine attacks and threats, provide clear and concise reporting on the health and wellness of network(s), and provide some meaningful information to upper management. By using some very simple methods outlined in this chapter to manage these flows of data, several clear pictures can be found. Using some simple data manipulation, high-level and general reports can be created to show the effectiveness of a security organization and its policies and processes.

AB  - Publisher Summary
The critical aspects of ensuring a system's stability are the ongoing monitoring and analysis of System event logs. Like UNIX systems, Microsoft Windows operating systems (OSs) have logging features that can aid in diagnosing system problems and ensuring that the system is optimized and secured. Most administrators do not make full use of these features because of the extensive amount of time it takes to read through thousands of log file entries. This makes it difficult for administrators to take a proactive approach to systems administration by eliminating problems before they become critical. This chapter discusses the way in which Log Parser can help with this task, making a tedious task not only easy but fun as well. The chapter discusses many of the features available in Log Parser for working with Windows event logs. There are a few key points to remember when working with these logs: (1) differentiating between single and multiple events is a critical feature in Log Parser for working with the Security event log; (2) differentiating between benign events and actual errors or warnings is very important for having an accurate view of your system environment; and (3) when working with applications and the Application event logs, it is important to have a thorough understanding of the specific application.

Log files are the most critical source of data for information technology systems. They need to be properly managed. This chapter discusses management of log files with Microsoft Log Parser. There are several areas to focus on when managing log files including conversion, rotation, archiving, and separation. The chapter discusses each aspect and shows some techniques that one can use to manage log files. It covers the administrative aspects of using Log Parser and discusses the methods to store log files in a logical and hierarchical manner. The chapter explains how to work backwards and separate the consolidated log files in order to run queries faster and limit the data to exactly what one needs.

AB  - Abstract
Incorporating security features is one of the most important and challenging tasks in designing distributed systems. Over the last decade, researchers and practitioners have come to recognize that the incorporation of security features should proceed by means of a structured, systematic approach, combining principles from both software and security engineering. Such systematic approaches, particularly those implying some sort of process aligned with the development life-cycle, are termed security methodologies. There are a number of security methodologies in the literature, of which the most flexible and, according to a recent survey, most satisfactory from an industry-adoption viewpoint are methodologies that encapsulate their security solutions in some fashion, especially via the use of security patterns. While the literature does present several mature pattern-driven security methodologies with either a general or a highly specific system applicability, there are currently no (pattern-driven) security methodologies specifically designed for general distributed systems. Going further, there are also currently no methodologies with mixed specific applicability, e.g. for both general and peer-to-peer distributed systems. In this paper we aim to fill these gaps by presenting a comprehensive pattern-driven security methodology – arrived at by applying a previously devised approach to engineering security methodologies – specifically designed for general distributed systems, which is also capable of taking into account the specifics of peer-to-peer systems as needed. Our methodology takes the principle of encapsulation several steps further, by employing patterns not only for the incorporation of security features (via security solution frames), but also for the modeling of threats, and even as part of its process. We illustrate and evaluate the presented methodology in detail via a realistic example – the development of a distributed system for file sharing and collaborative editing. In both the presentation of the methodology and example our focus is on the early life-cycle phases (analysis and design).

AB  - Abstract
Software maintenance is one of the major concerns in service oriented ecosystem with an ever-increasing importance. In many cases, the cost of software maintenance is higher than the cost of software development. In particular, long-lasting services, which operate in a dynamically changing environment, require continuous management and administration. One of the important administration actions is scaling management. The problem lies in responding to workload changes of the hosted services as fast as possible. This is especially important in regard to (but not limited to) cloud environments where unnecessary resource usage leads to unnecessary costs. In this paper, we are introducing the self-scalable services and scaling rules, which are intended to support development of self-scalable systems based on Service Oriented Architecture. We propose a design of a self-scalable service based on some of the well-known software development practices along with a definition of scaling rules, which express scaling policy for the service. Both concepts were evaluated in the context of a massively scalable platform for data farming. The evaluation demonstrates advantages of utilizing the proposed concepts to manage the platform in comparison with traditional platform management strategies based on fulfilling peak load.

AB  - Storage area networking (SAN) devices have become a critical IT component of almost every business today. The upside and intended consequences of using a SAN are to consolidate corporate data as well as reduce cost, complexity, and risks. The tradeoff and downside to implementing SAN technology are that the risks of large-scale data loss are higher in terms of both cost and reputation. With the rapid adoption of virtualization, SANs now house more than just data; they house entire virtual servers and huge clusters of servers in “enterprise clouds.” In addition to all the technical, management, deployment, and protection challenges, a SAN comes with a full range of legal regulations such as PCI, HIPAA, SOX, GLBA, SB1386, and many others. Companies keep their informational “crown jewels” on their SANs but in most cases do not understand all the architecture issues and risks involved, which can cost an organization huge losses. This chapter covers all the issues and security concerns related to storage area network security.

The System Security Plan is the most important document in the Security Package. IT sums up the system description, system boundary, architecture, and security control in one document. All systems that are general support systems or major applications must have a System Security Plan. When describing system boundaries, keep in mind that your description should be inclusive of and should discuss the systems you described in your Hardware and Software Inventory. The system delineated by the boundary definition should be consistent with what comes under the purview of the system owner. In the System Security Plan, you describe how all security controls are implemented.

One of the criteria for selection is cost considerations.

The second topic is on-site or physical security systems. Based on the TIA-942 standard, different tiers of data center should have different physical security systems. The physical security system will be organized with three layers, the physical layer, the organizational layer, and the infrastructure layer.

AB  - A sharp increase in malware and cyber-attacks has been observed in recent years. Analysing cyber-attacks on the affected digital devices falls under the purview of digital forensics. The Internet is the main source of cyber and malware attacks, which sometimes result in serious damage to the digital assets. The motive behind digital crimes varies – such as online banking fraud, information stealing, denial of services, security breaches, deceptive output of running programs and data distortion.

Digital forensics analysts use a variety of tools for data acquisition, evidence analysis and presentation of malicious activities. This leads to device diversity posing serious challenges for investigators.

For this reason, some attack scenarios have to be examined repeatedly, which entails tremendous effort on the part of the examiners when analysing the evidence. To counter this problem, Muhammad Shamraiz Bashir and Muhammad Naeem Ahmed Khan at the Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan propose a novel triage framework for digital forensics.

However, because most users of a cloud, whether it is a private or a public cloud, have certain expectations regarding the security of their data, service providers also must assure customers that the service they are providing is an appropriate and secure fit for their needs. In that regard, cloud service providers generally must have their products evaluated against commonly accepted criteria. Previous chapters in this book have discussed various aspects of cloud security. The security checklists in this chapter are intended to help readers develop their own lists for verifying the security of either a cloud service provider or a private cloud. The chapter begins with a review of existing work in this area. After highlighting the recommended checklists, the chapter then concludes with a section on checklist metrics.

AB  - If live system analysis is considered surgery, a forensic examination can be considered an autopsy of a malware-infected computer. Historically, it has been straightforward to uncover traces of malware on the file system and in the Registry of a compromised Windows computer. Today, however, attackers employ more antiforensic techniques to conceal their activities; thus, modern malware leaves limited traces on a compromised host and misdirects forensic examiners. Fortunately, a methodical approach to forensic examination, in which the system is analyzed from all perspectives, increases the chances of uncovering footprints the intruder failed to hide. This chapter provides a repeatable approach to conducting forensic examinations in malware incidents, increasing consistency across multiple computers and letting others evaluate the process and results. As readers will discover, they can apply this process to a compromised host and a test system purposely infected with malware, to learn more about how the malicious code behaves.

AB  - Customers of public cloud services do not need to concern themselves with the intricate details of their underlying cloud structure. In fact, a thorough understanding of the cloud service provider's architecture, infrastructure, policies, and procedures may not even be possible. However, customers do need to ensure that the cloud service provider's security claims are independently verified. Just as important as verification is the cloud service provider's willingness to be transparent about its security practices because customers also need to understand issues concerning security and governance of the service they are considering. The goal of this chapter is to present an overview of how to select a cloud service provider based on security requirements. Toward that end, the chapter examines security criteria prospective cloud service customers should consider. Some fall squarely in the realm of security, while others, such as service level agreements, data center location, and cloud elasticity, are security relevant.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter provides a forensic examination methodology for Linux computers involved in a Malware incident, with illustrative case examples. This forensic examination methodology is applied to both a compromised host and a test system purposely infected with Malware. When performing Malware forensics, there are aspects of a Linux computer that are most likely to contain information relating to the Malware installation and use. Forensic examinations of the compromised systems include a review of file hash values and signature mismatches, and examination of packed files, user accounts and other configuration information, and various logs. In addition, digital investigators perform keyword searches and inspect the file system and logs for distinctive Malware artifacts, and look for more subtle patterns of activities by performing temporal analysis using date stamps available in various locations on Linux system. Performing a risk analysis of the system, including its patch level, password strength, and other potential vulnerabilities in client and server applications reveals the attack vector.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Network forensics in the cloud-computing environment could be focused only on data that go to and from the systems that the company has access to, but that would miss other data. Network forensics needs to be part of and work with all the other components that comprise the entire system within the cloud. The network forensics investigator needs to understand that the cloud environment is the space that the company rents on another company's computer systems to perform the work. The cloud-computing model can also be very useful for forensics by allowing storage of very large log files on a storage instance or in a very large database for easy data retrieval and discovery. Network forensics can also have an influence on the outcome of an investigation into an event as long as data is collected at the box and at the entry and exit points of the company network. The use of in-built firewall logs, system logs, and other logs will generally point to an entry time, place, and IP address that can be used to help determine how the event is propagated through the network and what steps can be taken to help minimize any future event by providing solid data on the event. A large part of network forensics is being able to monitor the network traffic in order to isolate the number of servers that need to be taken down for the traditional forensics process.

AB  - Precise comprehension of a file system state at any given time is vital for performing digital forensic analyses. To uncover evidence of the digital crime, the logical representation of file system activities helps reconstruct post-event timeline of the unauthorized or malicious accesses made on a system. This paper describes a comparative performance analysis of the Bayesian networks and neural networks techniques to classify the state of file system activities in terms of execution of applications based on the pattern of manipulation of specific files during certain period of time. In particular, this paper discusses the construction of a Bayesian networks and neural networks from the predetermined knowledge of the manipulation of file system artifacts and their corresponding metadata information by a set of software applications. The variability amongst the execution patterns of various applications indicate that the Bayesian network-based model is a more appropriate tool as compared to neural networks because of its ability to learn and detect patterns even from an incomplete dataset. The focus of this paper is to highlight intrinsic significance of the learning approach of Bayesian network methodology in comparison to the techniques used for supervised learning in ordinary neural networks. The paper also highlights the efficacy of Bayesian network technique to proficiently handle large volumes of datasets.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Information security involves the protection of organizational assets from the disruption of business operations, modification of sensitive data, or disclosure of proprietary information. The protection of this data is usually described as maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the organization's assets, operations, and information. For information security managers, it is crucial to maintain a clear perspective of all the areas of business that require protection. Through collaboration with all business units, security managers must work security into the processes of all aspects of the organization, from employee training to research and development. Security is not an IT problem, but a business problem. Information security is a business problem in the sense that the entire organization must frame and solve security problems based on its own strategic drivers, not solely on technical controls aimed to mitigate one type of attack. Security goes beyond technical controls and encompasses people, technology, policy, and operations in a way that few other business objectives do. The evolution of a risk-based paradigm, as opposed to a technical solution paradigm for security, has made it clear that a secure organization does not result from securing technical infrastructure alone.

AB  - Cloud computing is a method of delivering computing resources. Cloud computing services ranging from data storage and processing to software, such as customer relationship management systems, are now available instantly and on demand. In times of financial and economic hardship, this new low cost of ownership model for computing has gotten lots of attention and is seeing increasing global investment. Generally speaking, cloud computing provides implementation agility, lower capital expenditure, location independence, resource pooling, broad network access, reliability, scalability, elasticity, and ease of maintenance. While in most cases cloud computing can improve security due to ease of management, the provider’s lack of knowledge and experience can jeopardize customer environments. This chapter aims to discuss various cloud computing environments and methods to make them more secure for hosting companies and their customers.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Cybercrime is possible because computers and networks are not properly secured. Only by understanding how computer security works—and how it sometimes does not—can one predict where and how network attacks and intrusions will occur, track the actions of cybercriminals who break into systems, build evidence based on those break-ins, and help the victims of cybercrime protect themselves from future attacks. The first step in preventing cybercrime is to secure computer systems and networks against attacks. No system can be completely secure, but the goal of security is to present a barrier significant enough to repel most—if not all—attackers. Generally, the elements or issues that must be addressed to create a secure environment are the same for any type of system. But the specifics of how to implement a security policy and how to make individual security changes vary from one operating system to the next, and different technologies such as broadband, mainframe systems, and wireless networks present their own unique challenges. When planning security, one must take into consideration not only the method by which Internet access is brought to a system, but also the software programs used to interact with Internet-based resources. Web browsers are notoriously vulnerable to numerous attacks. However, with a bit of effort to keep the software up-to-date and configure settings for the best security, most common attacks can be avoided.

If the evaluation team is pressed for time (which sometimes happens) and elects to scrutinize only one document in your entire C&amp;A package, skimming through the others, it is likely that that the one document they will sift through with a fine-toothed comb will be the System Security Plan. Some federal agencies use a System Security Authorization Agreement (SSAA) in lieu of a System Security Plan.The SSAA historically has been used by agencies that make use of the DITSCAP C&amp;A methodology.

AB  - Fault and attack survivability issues concerning security in all optical networks require a new approach that takes into consideration the physical characteristics of optical networks. Furthermore, unlike the case in electronic networks that regenerate signals at every node, attack detection and isolation schemes may not have access to the overhead bits used to transport supervisory information between regenerators or switching sites to perform their functions. This chapter presents an analysis of attack and protection problems in optical networks. It also proposes a conceptual framework for modeling attack problems and protection schemes for optical networks.

AB  - Software systems are becoming more open, distributed, pervasive, and connected. In such systems, the relationships between loosely-coupled application elements become non-deterministic. Coordination can be viewed as a way of making such loosely coupled systems more adaptable. In this paper we show how coordination-systems, which are analogous to nervous systems, can be defined independently from the functional systems they regulate. Such coordination-systems are a network of organisers and contracts. We elaborate how contracts can be used to monitor, regulate and configure the interactions between clusters of software entities called roles. Abstract management contracts regulate the flow of control through the roles and provide monitoring interception points. Concrete contracts are domain specific and allow the specification of performance conditions. These contracts bind clusters of roles into self-managed composites — each composite with its own organiser role. The organiser roles can control, create, abrogate and reassign contracts. Adaptive systems are built from a recursive structure of such self-managed composites. A prototype framework has been built from which adaptive applications can be derived. This framework uses association-aspects as a mechanism to implement contracts.

AB  - Many organizations now have an IT security strategy in place covering the management of IT security facilities and activities within the organization. Computer forensics has previously been an activity limited mainly within the bounds of law enforcement agencies. However, commercial organizations are increasingly making use of computer forensics in areas such as fraud, money laundering, the accessing or distribution of pornography, or harassment. In this article we outline a framework for the management of computer forensic facilities and activities within a corporate setting.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Security encompasses people, process, and technology. By finding the right combination of these, an organization can successfully reduce risk. One key piece of technology needed to address security risk is a central logging and analysis solution that leverages the investment that has already been made in the organization's technology up to a higher and more useful level. A central analysis system reduces operational costs by freeing up other resources to focus on other critical issues. It acts as a focal point for real-time and forensic investigation, incident management, remediation, reporting, and compliance. This technology is referred to as Enterprise Security Management (ESM), but it is sometimes called Security Information Management (SIM) or SEM Security Event Management (SEM). ESM software is the result of SIM evolving from traditional security event monitoring into a more robust, enterprise-wide approach that considers everything in an environment—hardware, software, data, and people, as well as related risk levels, business functions, and compliance relationships. ESM is generally enterprise-level software deployed on enterprise-level servers with high-performance information analysis tools, a forensic database, interactive analyst console, and real-time event connectors.

AB  - As systems, clouds are massively complex in terms of scale and orchestration of resources. This massive scale, along with a disciplined appearance and repeated patterns, are the qualities comprising a successful cloud implementation. However, a cloud's complexity doesn't necessarily equate to its level of security, because much of a cloud amounts to repeated patterns at massive scale, and the security benefits of this are significant. Fortunately, thanks to its inherent qualities, cloud computing has tremendous potential for organizations to improve their information security posture. The first two chapters of this book covered many of the qualities and promises of cloud computing, examined cloud service and cloud deployment models, and discussed security aspects of clouds. This chapter begins by investigating some of those security issues more closely, and then discusses how to assess risk tolerance. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the legal and regulatory landscape in which clouds operate.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter focuses on organizational and operational security. Organizational and operational security is mostly concerned with people, processes, and procedures. The people within your organization can represent the biggest threat. These threats could be intentional and unintentional. One can use technology to enforce the processes and procedures, but a lot of it has to do with user education and training. One needs to ensure that employees know what to do in certain situations. Whether there's some sort of security incident or natural disaster, all employees need to understand their roles and responsibilities and the procedures they need to follow. Having a plan provides structure and helps prevent confusion and mistakes. Formalized policies and procedures are crucial in ensuring that employees understand and follow the security guidelines. An end user education program helps to drive home the key themes and message of the security policy. After all, what good are policies and procedures if no one knows about them? No matter how hard one plans, there will be security-related incidents. They could be big or small. But one must have a plan for dealing with them. If one doesn't have a plan, a relatively small incident could have a huge impact on organization. Once the plan is developed, it should be make sure to test it. A plan that doesn't work is just as bad as not having a plan at all.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter takes look at the fundamental paradox that exists between protecting our privacy and the need to access and distribute information. The chapter also discusses common security threats, risks, and options for countermeasures to protect and enhance the security of an e-commerce environment. Privacy is a significant concern for anyone who uses the internet. In business, it would be prudent to consider privacy issues from the very beginning, when designing an e-commerce environment and building data warehouses or, any of the transactional systems (for example, e-CRM) that will provide content to the data warehouse. The current trends in privacy policy seem to be heading in the direction of protecting the end user/consumer. These changes in policy direction will force e-commerce to communicate their privacy policies openly to anyone visiting their sites or using their systems. The amount of damage and collateral damage that can be caused by a malicious hacker has dramatically increased with the Internet. Moreover, the internet serves as a target-rich environment with thousands of systems available and waiting for attack. Businesses engaged in e-commerce would serve themselves if they take the time to define their security policy, their security plans and strategies, and to educate their personnel on the risk and need for security.

Information is an essential asset for organizations, because it supports the day-today operations, and facilitates decision-making by the organization’s key stakeholders. The challenge facing organizations is how to provide access to this asset without compromising its integrity. This asset is received and distributed by the organization through various distribution channels, which is connected together by the telecommunications network. These channels include:

•
Email
•
Internet
•
Applications (e.g. Financial, Logistics, Retail, Property and Construction, Energy etc.)
•
DBMS (MS SQL Server, Oracle, DB2, Sybase, etc.)

AB  - Abstract
Most existing approaches for detecting viruses involve signature-based analyses to match the precise patterns of malware threats. However, the problem of classification accuracy regarding unspecified malware detection depends on correct extraction and completeness of training signatures. In practice, malware detection system uses the generalization ability of support vector models (SVMs) to guarantee a small classification error by machine learning. This study developed an automatic malware detection system by training an SVM classifier based on behavioural signatures. A cross-validation scheme was used for solving classification accuracy problems by using SVMs associated with 60 families of real malware. The experimental results reveal that the classification error decreases as the sizing of testing data is increased. For different sizing (N) of malware samples, the prediction accuracy of malware detection goes up to 98.7% with N = 100 . The overall detection accuracy of the SVC is more than 85% for unspecific mobile malware.

AB  - The UK government took a bruising in the headlines (Sep 2008) after a Home Office contractor lost a USB stick containing unencrypted data on all 84,000 prisoners in England and Wales. As a result, the Home Office terminated the £1.5 million contract with the management consultancy firm.

The world woke up to the largest attempted bank fraud ever when the UK’s National Hi-Tech Crime Unit foiled the world’s largest potential bank robbery in March 2005. With the help of the security supervisor, thieves masquerading as cleaning staff installed hardware keystroke loggers on computers within the London branch of a Japanese bank, to steal £220m.

It is indeed sobering to imagine that any organisation could fall victim to such events and the damage an insider can do. The consulting firm lost the contract worth £1.5 million due to a small mistake by an employee. The London branch of the Japanese Bank would have lost £220 million had not the crime been foiled.

Insider threat is a reality. Insiders commit fraud or steal sensitive information when motivated by money or revenge. Well-meaning employees can compromise the security of an organisation with their overzealousness in getting their job done. Every organisation has a varied mix of employees, consultants, management, partners and complex infrastructure and that makes handling insider threats a daunting challenge. With insider attacks, organisations face potential damage through loss of revenue, loss of reputation, loss of intellectual property or even loss of human life.

The insider threat problem is more elusive and perplexing than any other threat. Assessing the insider threat is the first step to determine the likelihood of any insider attack. Technical solutions do not suffice since insider threats are fundamentally a people issue. Therefore, a three-pronged approach - technological, behavioural and organisational assessment is essential in facilitating the prediction of insider threats and pre-empt any insider attack thus improving the organization’s security, survivability, and resiliency in light of insider threats.

AB  - Process memory associated with malware, together with passwords, Internet Protocol addresses, Security Event Log entries, and other contextual details, can provide digital investigators with an understanding of malware and its use on a Windows system. Therefore, it is important to preserve, in a forensically sound manner, both volatile data and select nonvolatile data memory on a system that is suspected to be infected with malware. This chapter provides a methodology for preserving volatile data on a Windows system during a malware incident, with the assumption that readers possess a live response toolkit consisting of trusted tools, or a tool suite designed to automatically collect digital evidence from Windows systems during incident response. The “Tool Box” section of the chapter discusses many live response tool suites available today. Ultimately, the chapter aims to provide readers with a walkthrough of the live response process and the digital evidence that should be collected.

AB  - The primary role of the security officer is to advise senior management on the optimal deployment of security resources. This is a task of considerable complexity and it is suggested that the security officer would be assisted by computer took that provide an effective security model of the system under consideration, so that the system risks may be identified and prioritized.

The development of such a model, based upon a risk data repository, is described. It is also suggested that a countermeasure architecture may be used to relate external threats to the logical nodes of system platforms, and thence to physical and procedural realities of the organization.

The effort of software development, data collection, encoding and entry for such a model could well prove to be excessive in terms of the expected benefits. It is therefore proposed, in this paper, that hypertext be employed to allow pre-existing data to be readily entered in its native form, and then manipulated by the security officer.

This model has been used in a banking environment and the hypertext version has been employed in the study of a computerized university student admission system.

The chapter discusses the types of data security problems. The categories where data protections are falling are physical security, communication security, and operational security (database security, operating security, computer viruses). Cryptography is the science of transforming data, using a key, so that the data becomes unintelligible to those who do not have the key (or more precisely, the inverse transformation). The chapter presents a detailed discussion of the different types of cryptosystems followed by the application of cryptography for solving many of the computer security problems. Classifications of cryptosystems are according to function, number of keys and method of application to the protection of data. A symmetric cryptosystem is one in which the encryption key and the decryption key are the same. An asymmetric cryptosystem is one in which the decryption key is different from the encryption key. Cryptosystems are subject to different types of attacks. The method of attacking cryptosystem is cryptanalysis.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Infrastructure refers to those resources and items required to successfully support and operate information systems. Security refers to policies, procedures, software, and hardware designed to insure that data in information systems are protected against accidental or inappropriate destruction, alteration, or access. Properly supported, infrastructure competency allows an organization to maintain agility in responding to strategic directives and tactical changes. Infrastructure and security together provide the day-to-day operational support for the hardware and software, thus forming a critical component of the organization. Proper management of security requires attention to infrastructure and information system designs, as well as the organization adhering to strict and appropriate personnel practices. Both infrastructure and security are among the many invisible processes and resources required to implement and sustain a successful clinical computing system. Some resources, such as a data center, must be available prior to implementation of these systems; many other resources, such as those supporting security, should be available prior to implementation, but are often deferred until problems occur. Most infrastructure requirements continue and expand after the system is in use. Although organizations can purchase services through outside contracted vendors, those developing skills in their own personnel can use resources more cost effectively, saving as much as 25–40%, particularly in areas such as disaster management. In the longer term, the use of contracted services can result in the loss of skills necessary for making strategic decisions, putting into question whether the estimated savings of contracting can be achieved.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Auditing is an official examination and verification of information. The best approach to auditing is to find a middle ground in terms of effort and cost to meet the spirit of the organization's requirements, and then working with the auditor ahead of audit time. Security assessment and auditing can be thought of as incident prevention. By having a sound auditing strategy in place could potentially save money and legal liabilities. The objective of an internal security audit is to evaluate the security of corporate hosts and networks, and this evaluation identifies symptomatic security issues (vulnerabilities). Auditing helps in maintaining a healthy and secure environment. A properly implemented auditing and scanning policy can help prevent issues. The chapter discusses different assessment types and the assessment process. It also explains the realistic expectations from the usage of a vulnerability assessment scanning tool.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter defines operations security. Organizational Operations Security is about maximizing the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the systems used by the organization using a risk-based approach. To be effective, it is important that all standards, guidelines, and procedures are clearly defined in advance and are aligned to the organization's management practices. Operations Security consists of a series of controls that are designed to maintain the security of the organization's resources from design to deployment to disposal. This is achieved through minimizing the effects of the threats and extent of the vulnerabilities faced by the organization. This leads to reduced asset losses and thus lower risk. Operational controls are also described that are implemented to protect the day-to-day running of the organization. These involve everything from hardware controls (such as maintenance) through to controls designed to monitor privileged-entities. Operational controls include the monitoring and general review of systems. Media controls expand on the idea of controls that cover the handling of sensitive information.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Storage area networking (SAN) devices have become a critical IT component of almost every business today. The upside and intended consequences of using a SAN are to consolidate corporate data as well as reduce cost, complexity, and risks. The tradeoff and downside to implementing SAN technology are that the risks of large-scale data loss are higher in terms of both cost and reputation. With the rapid adoption of virtualization, SANs now house more than just data; they house entire virtual servers and huge clusters of servers in “enterprise clouds.” Perhaps a main reason SANs have emerged as the leading advanced storage option is because they can often alleviate many if not all the data storage “pain points” of IT managers. For quite some time IT managers have been in a predicament in which some servers, such as database servers, run out of hard disk space rather quickly, whereas other servers, such as application servers, tend to not need a whole lot of disk space and usually have storage to spare. When a SAN is implemented, the storage can be spread throughout servers on an as-needed basis.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the concepts necessary in the performance of a technical audit of Microsoft Windows systems. The initial step in any audit is defining the scope. Most initial audits of Windows or any other system boils down to obtaining basic system information, checking the system and application patch levels and vulnerability status, checking which services that are running, verifying which applications are installed, validating the security systems and controls on the system, and assessing the overall risk. For Windows-specific guidance to the low-level controls, it is necessary to use tools and techniques that are included both as features available within Windows or with additions to Windows or available from third party vendors. An audit of a Windows not only involves auditing it at a point in time to see whether it is properly configured and secured and meets the business requirement, but more so would need to encompass how the system is being monitored and maintained over time.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the network security basics. A good network security system will help to remove the temptations easily, and will be as transparent to the users as possible. File servers on which sensitive data is stored and infrastructure servers that provide mission critical services such as logon authentication and access control should be placed in a highly secure location. At the minimum, servers should be in a locked room where only those who need to work directly with the servers have access. Denial of Service (DOS) attacks are one of the most popular choices of Internet hackers who want to disrupt a network's operations. The objective of the DOS attacker is to bring down the network, denying service to its legitimate users. DOS attacks are easy to initiate; software is readily available from hacker Web sites and warez newsgroups that will allow anyone to launch a DOS attack with little or no technical expertise. The Domain Name System (DNS) DOS attack exploits the difference in size between a DNS query and a DNS response, in which all of the network's bandwidth is tied up by bogus DNS queries. The security plan should also address the procedures for reporting security breaches, both internally, and if the police or other outside agencies are to be brought in. It is suggested that password change policies should prevent users from making only slight changes.

AB  - Publisher Summary
AAA is a set of primary concepts that aid in understanding computer and network security as well as access control. AAA is used to support the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) security concept, in addition to providing the framework for access to networks and equipment using the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service and Terminal Access Controller Access Control System. AAA is a group of processes used to protect the data, equipment, and confidentiality of property and information. AAA consists of three separate areas that work together—namely, access control, authentication, and auditing. Access control can be defined as a policy, software component, or hardware component that is used to grant or deny access to a resource. This can be an advanced component such as a Smart Card, a biometric device, Remote Access Service (RAS), and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Access control has three subcomponents: Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Discretionary Access Control (DAC), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Authentication can be defined as the process used to verify that a machine or user attempting access to the networks or resources is, in fact, the entity being presented. Auditing is the process of tracking and reviewing events, errors, access, and authentication attempts on a system.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter reinforces the concept that many of the components that are required to secure a VoIP/Data network are likely to exist within the current infrastructure. It argues that information security is critical to an organization and that the security policy underpins all other security efforts. Then it reviews the processes required to implement a functional security policy and looks at some of the critical factors that determine the value of a security policy. The chapter provides a worksheet that will allow a gap analysis on the existing security policies to be performed. A commented sample VoIP Security Policy module is provided for the user as a template at the end of this chapter.

AB  - This study presents a multiagent architecture aimed at detecting SQL injection attacks, which are one of the most prevalent threats for modern databases. The proposed architecture is based on a hierarchical and distributed strategy where the functionalities are structured on layers. SQL-injection attacks, one of the most dangerous attacks to online databases, are the focus of this research. The agents in each one of the layers are specialized in specific tasks, such as data gathering, data classification, and visualization. This study presents two key agents under a hybrid architecture: a classifier agent that incorporates a Case-Based Reasoning engine employing advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages, and a visualizer agent that integrates several techniques to facilitate the visual analysis of suspicious queries. The former incorporates a new classification model based on a mixture of a neural network and a Support Vector Machine in order to classify SQL queries in a reliable way. The latter combines clustering and neural projection techniques to support the visual analysis and identification of target attacks. The proposed approach was tested in a real-traffic case study and its experimental results, which validate the performance of the proposed approach, are presented in this paper.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Server performance is regarded as an important issue in the mission-critical business environment. It is noted that poor performance can have a huge negative impact on the ability of workers to do their jobs, and thus on productivity and the company's bottom line. Monitoring and optimizing performance of network servers is one of the administrator's most important tasks, and it is important to continually collect and analyze performance data to ensure that any problems can be taken care of before they impact end users. Security events are another important area that the administrator must be aware of in order to protect the integrity of the organization's network and data. Windows Server 2003 provides administrators with built-in tools for monitoring performance issues and detecting security breaches. These include simple monitoring tools and powerful monitoring tools along with a set of useful command-line utilities. For auditing security events, the security log provides vital information for tracking successful and failed breaches of security.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the process of securing the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) infrastructure by reviewing and validating the existing security infrastructure. Addition of VoIP components to a preexisting data network is the ideal opportunity to review and bolster existing security policy, architecture, and processes. It discusses many of the ways to reuse portions of existing security infrastructure as preparation to add voice traffic to the mix. After the management made the decision to move to a converged network, and before the new architecture is completed, it is important that one or more representatives of the security group participate in the architectural discussions. A truly dedicated attacker, finding little means of accessing an organization's internal IP network over a public network such as the Internet, often turn to physical penetration to bypass the organization's logical perimeter security controls. Supporting Services describes the functions and security characteristics of VoIP supplementary services. The servers that host these services should be hardened and patched per security policy guidelines. Unified Management details some of the responsibilities when designing the monitoring network for VoIP infrastructure.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter provides the framework for creating a general Information Technology (IT) security project as part of an overall corporate IT security project plan strategy. As with all of the individual security area projects (ISAPs) discussed in this book, this is intended to be a template to use as a starting point. One might wonder what a “general” IT security project plan consists of. It discusses the security assessment and auditing function in great detail. Most corporate IT security plans start with a thorough assessment so that the problem statement can be developed. The chapter looks at different ways to view the security assessment as a whole, including looking at the perimeter systems, internal network, server and host systems, applications and databases, and data. It's important to understand the elements that comprise an assessment, which typically fall into the vulnerability scanning, pen testing, and risk assessment, with the caveat that any pen testing should be limited in scope prior to implementing a security project. The audit function includes auditing physical, technological, and administrative policies and procedures. It also looks briefly at access control, authentication, and auditing as part of overall security assessment.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the reasons that necessitate information security. Without security, a company can suffer from theft or alteration of data, legal ramifications, and other issues that all result in monetary losses. Consequently, corporations need to create and enforce an information security policy. Information security involves making sure that only authorized people and systems have access to information. The three primary areas of concern in information security are confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Encryption is a commonly used tool for achieving confidentiality. Authentication and authorization also help with confidentiality. Integrity ensures that unauthorized parties do not modify the information and that the information can be relied on. Checksums and hashes are used to validate data integrity, as being transaction-logging systems. Availability, in addition to the simple backups of data, includes ensuring that systems remain accessible in the event of a denial of service (DOS) attack. It also means that critical data be protected from erasure. Firewalls are devices that regulate and filter traffic between networks.The chapter also explores different types of firewalls available in the market and explains how firewalls work. It discusses the two main security certifications that Cisco offers: the Cisco Security Specialist 1 (CSS-1) and the Cisco Certified Internet Expert (CCIE) Security.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses how Microsoft supports security management in Windows Server 2003 in the following three key areas: security policy management, security patch management, and security-related auditing. Security management is a critical security service that guarantees that the security settings and software on computer platforms and security infrastructure servers can be configured and maintained in an easy and coherent way. The security configuration together with the software that is allowed to run on a computer system is defined in a security policy. Computer platforms can become trusted platforms if the security policy is audited—this means checked for compliance by a trusted entity—at regular intervals. The security policy for a computer platform defines all security-related configuration settings for that platform including all the configuration settings. Most of the settings can be configured using group policy object settings and others can be configured though the security configuration editor while some cannot be configured using a Microsoft security policy configuration tool.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter demonstrates the value of preserving volatile data, and provides practical guidance for preserving such data in a forensically sound manner. The value of volatile data is not limited to process memory associated with Malware, and includes passwords, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, Security Event Log entries, and other contextual details that can provide a more complete understanding of the Malware and its use on a system. In a powered-up state, a subject system contains critical ephemeral information that reveals the state of the system. This volatile data is sometimes referred to as stateful information. Incident response forensics, or live response, is the process of acquiring the stateful information from the subject system while it remains powered on. The Order of Volatility is considered when collecting data from a live system to ensure that critical system data is acquired before it is lost or the system is powered down. The chapter provides methodology for preserving volatile data on a Windows system during a Malware incident, and uses case scenarios to demonstrate the collection process as well as the strengths and shortcoming of the data acquired in the process.

Computers and networks have undoubtedly revolutionized the way people work. Windows 2000 supports several authentication protocols, including NTLM Kerberos v5. Distributed Password Authentication, Extensible Authentication Protocol, and Secure Channel. The two protocols used for network authentication, for logging on locally or as an interactive user, are NTLM and Kerberos v5. The Security Configuration Tool Set introduces a new and more efficient way to manage security parameters in Windows 2000. Using this new set of configuration and management tools, the Administrator can configure and manage the security policies for a single machine or an entire domain or OU. The file is encrypted using a Secret Key called a File Encryption Key, along with the DESX algorithm, and the File Encryption Key is then encrypted by the owner's public key.

This chapter discusses basic diligence efforts needed to keep a security program healthy and to mitigate risks to an organization. The objective of a security audit is to assess the quantity of risk and the effectiveness of the organization's risk-management processes as they relate to the security measures instituted to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and to instill accountability for actions taken on the organization's systems. Organizations often inaccurately perceive information security as the state or condition of various controls at a given time. Security is an ongoing process whereby the condition of security controls is just one indicator of the overall security posture. Other indicators include the ability of the institution to assess its posture continually and react appropriately in the face of rapidly changing threats, technologies, and business conditions. This requires an organization to continuously integrate processes, people, and technology to mitigate risk in accordance with risk assessment and acceptable risk tolerance.

The chapter explains how to work with Windows Server 2003's Internet Protocol Security (IPSec). The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) designed the IP Security (IPSec) specifications. The IP Security Working Group of the IETF developed IPSec as an industry standard for encrypting the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) traffic within networking environments. The two main purposes of IPSec are to protect IP packets and give network administrators the ability to use packet faltering as a defense against network attacks. These include two primary protocols: the Authentication Header (AH) protocol and the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol. Windows Server 2003 includes Microsoft's implementation of the Internet standard IP Security protocol. IPSec is not required to be supported by any intermediary computer that routes data from the source to destination IP address, unless Network Address Translation (NAT) or packet filtering is implemented on the firewall.

AB  - Publisher Summary
The security configuration tool set is a collection of security configuration and management programs included in Windows 2000. The primary goal of each of these components is to make it easier to manage enterprise-wide security parameters. The administrator can group the Tool Set components together into a single Microsoft management console (MMC) and manage security for the entire enterprise from a central location. This chapter introduces the functions and uses of Windows 2000 Security Configuration Tool Set. The tool set is a response to systems administrators' need for a central, easy-to-use program that allows the configuration of domain, organizational unit, and local security. It makes possible to configure and manage various security parameters from a single, centralized interface. In addition to conveniently bringing together widely disparate programs into a single interface, the Security Configuration and Analysis snap-in allows the administrator to analyze a local machine's current configuration. This analysis can be performed against security templates, so that the network manager can compare the present configuration to a proposed ideal configuration, which can, then be applied with a couple of simple clicks of the mouse.

It focuses on generic computer and Internet security concepts and describes a way to develop a comprehensive security plan for organization. The chapter explains the nuances of network security in general and Internet security in particular; and explores why it is necessary and how a comprehensive security policy can be created to protect networks from unauthorized access. In order to understand how firewalls are used in a network, it is necessary to understand the basics of network security. A firewall is not a “security solution” per se; instead, it is part of the security solution. However, a firewall is a big part of most network security solutions. A firewall is the guardian to the castle at the moat—the firewall decides what is let in and what is let out. This is done through firewall rules, which are policy-defined. A firewall can be various devices, from a Solaris system to a separate hardware appliance.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter explores the use of security templates in basic Windows 2000. It begins with a review of the Windows 2000 active directory. Active directory is the first directory service ever created. In fact, directory services have been available in a variety of network operating systems. Novell's NetWare has used the Novell directory service for quite some time now. Directory services are used primarily for organizing, locating, and managing network information. Active directory makes Windows 2000 tick. Windows 2000 relies on active directory for all types of things. The chapter examines the basic security tools at ones' disposal—those that ship with Windows 2000, those that can be found in the Windows 2000 server resource kit, and those that can be obtained from elsewhere. Thereafter, the chapter examines how security is configured via templates and group policy by taking an item-by-item approach. Each configurable item is presented along with its default setting and usage. Based on this understanding, the chapter describes the various methods of deploying security templates and security configurations. Finally, the chapter analyzes the security settings using several tools available to a user.

AB  - In recent years, the concept of e-Diagnostics and e-Maintenance is proposed in the semiconductor industry. By using Internet and information technologies, e-Diagnostics and e-Maintenance intend to provide equipment specialists with the remote capabilities of connectivity, manipulation, configuration, performance monitoring, and data collection and analysis on equipment to achieve the goal of promptly diagnosing, repairing, and maintaining equipment. In this paper, new-generation information software technologies and object-oriented technologies, such as Web Services, XML signature, XML encryption, UML, etc. are used to develop an e-Diagnostics/Maintenance framework with security considerations. The proposed framework can achieve the automaton of diagnostic processes and the integration of diagnostics and maintenance information under a secure communication infrastructure.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter introduces the functions and uses of the Windows 2000 Security Configuration Tool Set. The Tool Set is a response to systems administrators' need for a central, easy-to-use program that will allow configuration of domain, organizational unit, and local security. In Windows NT 4.0, configuration of various security parameters required using multiple tools, such as User Manager, User Manager for Domains, Transmission control protocol (TCP)/ Internet protocol (IP) properties, direct registry edits, and the Remote Access Server (RAS) administrator. The Tool Set makes it possible to configure and manage these security services from a single, centralized interface. In addition to conveniently bringing together formerly widely disparate programs into a single interface, the Security Configuration and Analysis snap-in allows the administrator to analyze a local machine's current configuration. This analysis can be performed against security templates, so that the network manager can compare the present configuration to a proposed ideal configuration, which can then be applied with a couple of simple clicks of the mouse. The Tool Set allows the administrator to handle the configuration and management of the Windows 2000 security scheme.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Computer security involves many aspects of safekeeping, from protection of the physical equipment to protection of the electronic bits and bytes, which make up the information that resides on the network. Network security solutions can be loosely divided into three categories: hardware, software, and human. This chapter provides an overview of the basic security concepts and examines all four security objectives and the three categories of security solution. It discusses Internet security and acceleration's (ISA's) firewall functionality and how Microsoft has improved security in Windows 2000. To get the most out of ISA's features, one must be able to recognize the security threats to which network is subject and understand a little about the motivations of typical intruders. It is not necessary to be a hacker to prevent network from hacking attempts, but it benefits to know something about how unscrupulous hackers think and how they do their dirty work. A number of hardware-based security solutions and even more software-based firewalls are on the market. A good security plan is one that meets the needs of IT administration, company management, and network users. The best way to ensure that security plan meets these criteria is to involve people from all levels of the organization in the planning process.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter provides an overview on the connectivity functions of routers and switches on a network. Routers direct traffic in and out of the enterprise network and referred as the first line of defense when the network is connecting to the Internet. When people think about securing their demilitarized zones (DMZ), they mostly think about firewalls, intrusion detection systems, virtual private networks (VPNs), and hardening of servers within the DMZ. These are all parts of the process, but there is more to securing a DMZ than considering just these items. Some DMZ planners overlook hardening the touters or switches supporting the DMZ so that they cannot be exploited and used as tools to penetrate the network. Routers and switches connect all the devices on the DMZ to the enterprise network as well as the rest of the world; they are the devices that connect the bastion hosts, firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection systems to build the infrastructure. This makes touters and switches prime targets for hackers to exploit and glean information about the network they support or to use as springboards to other devices. Routers and switches on the DMZ and anywhere else on the network can also be used to protect resources that they connect via security features, including access control lists (ACLs), virtual local area networks (VLANs), and private VLANs. The chapter also presents information on the designing, configuration, and important security features of routers and switches that enable them to run securely and protect the devices that they connect.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Service-level agreement (SLA) data must be negotiated, fair, measurable, and have some level of accountability for nonperformance. It must be subject to periodic review and must go through an approval process. One should never accept an SLA as valid or binding if the items defined in it cannot be benchmarked against some standard and subsequently measured against that benchmark to evaluate performance. If that is the situation, it is definitely time to sit down and revise that SLA to something more reasonable. Many times, SLAs are written without the proper level of participation or negotiation from the support groups, and unreasonable expectations are set. The support group may try to uphold such expectations in good faith, but they are doomed to failure because the expectations are set higher than are reasonable. The support team, working as hard as it possibly can, will bear the brunt of much criticism that will be unwarranted because expectations were not reasonable.

AB  - In computer and network security, standard approaches to intrusion detection and response attempt to detect and prevent individual attacks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are real-time software for risk assessment by monitoring for suspicious activity at the network and system layer. Software scanner allows network administrator to audit the network for vulnerabilities and thus securing potential holes before attackers take advantage of them.

In this paper we try to define the intruder, types of intruders, detection behaviors, detection approaches and detection techniques. This paper presents a structural approach to the IDS by introducing a classification of IDS. It presents important features, advantages and disadvantages of each detection approach and the corresponding detection techniques. Furthermore, this paper introduces the wireless intrusion protection systems.

The goal of this paper is to place some characteristics of good IDS and examine the positioning of intrusion prevention as part of an overall layered security strategy and a review of evaluation criteria for identifying and selecting IDS and IPS. With this, we hope to introduce a good characteristic in order to improve the capabilities for early detection of distributed attacks in the preliminary phases against infrastructure and take a full spectrum of manual and automatic response actions against the source of attacks.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Paying attention to the data that exist when dealing with a device can help determine what and why an event is taking place. It could help detect potential security exposures that could or could not exist in the application by watching the data that is being sent to the device. Physical devices need to always notify some other device or security subsystem when failures occur. If an attack is detected and the risk involved with the device is high, meaning the attacker could gain access to significantly important data, the device would be closed; this means that the device purposefully stops working and the devices can be reinitialized through possible physical interaction. Address information is one of the most important pieces of data to audit because it will allow forensic analysts to possibly track criminals if an event occurs.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Within any organization, security should be a prime concern for all IT managers or professionals. The need to provide secure services increases as networks grow and become more complex. As more companies link to and provide new Internet-related services, administrators must understand and provide a secure network environment. There are risks associated with new and existing technologies, and an administrator who does not know what tools and options are available can cause more damage than good. Windows 2000 includes new advanced features and tool sets, including major security revisions and additions that provide a more stable and secure platform. Another feature is the Encrypting File System (EFS). In conjunction with NT File System , this provides a more advanced file and folder security feature set. The security configuration tool set has been created to ease the deployment of security configurations. The EFS is used to provide a more secure method of storing files and folders. With security becoming vitally necessary in every environment, additional and more advanced tools are needed to keep up with the changing times. Windows 2000 provides enhancements and new features that provide this additional level of security.

AB  - Publisher Summary
The chapter explains the installing and configuring of the ISA firewall software. It discusses default System Policy and Firewall configuration after installation is complete. There are several key pre-installation tasks and considerations one needs to address before installing the ISA firewall software. These include system requirements, configuring the routing table, DNS server placement, and so on. The routing table on the ISA firewall machine should be configured before one installs the ISA firewall software. The routing table should include routes to all the networks that are not local to the ISA firewall's network interfaces. These routing table entries are required because the ISA firewall can have only a single default gateway. The routing table entries are critical to support the ISA firewall's “network-within-a- Network” scenarios. A network within a network is a network ID located behind a NIC on the ISA firewall that is a nonlocal network.

AB  - In the last few years, Model-Driven Development (MDD), Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD), and Component-Based Software Development (CBSD) have become interesting alternatives for the design and construction of complex distributed applications. Although these methodological approaches share the principle of separation of concerns and their further integration as key factors to obtaining high-quality and evolvable large software systems, they usually each address this principle from their own particular perspective. In the present work, we combine Component-Based and Aspect-Oriented Software Developments in a Model Driven software process targeted at the development of complex systems. This process constitutes an enhancement of the separation of concerns by allowing the isolation of crosscutting concerns in both Platform Independent and Platform Specific models. Following a pure MDD philosophy, a set of model transformations are used to generate the system, from preliminary models to the final source code for the Corba Component Model platform. A twofold empirical analysis was used to evaluate the approach’s benefits in terms of two internal quality attributes: modularity and complexity. Conclusions were drawn from this evaluation regarding other quality attributes correlated with these two – stability, changeability, error-proneness, and reusability. An Eclipse plug-in was developed to drive the development of the entire system from early modeling to late deployment stages.

AB  - Publisher Summary
The chapter discusses issues related to planning and installing an ISA firewall. It also discusses the default system policy and firewall configuration after installation is complete. The chapter provides step-by-step instructions on how to install ISA Server in each of two possible configurations: installing ISA 2004 on a multihomed server and installing ISA 2004 on a single-NIC server. ISA Server 2004 can run on either a Windows 2000 Server or a Windows Server 2003 machine. The chapter discusses some of the differences in functionality based on which operating system is used and explores some of the things one need to watch during installation to avoid problems later. ISA Server 2004 includes a number of network templates that are positioned to help the new ISA Server 2004 firewall administrators. It examines the front-end firewall, edge firewall, back-end firewall, trihomed DMZ, and unihomed firewall templates, and explains how they can be used to assist the ISA Server 2004 firewall administrator get up and running with simple and complex networking setups. It also explores the upgrade issues, specifically how to upgrade an ISA Server 2000 computer to ISA Server 2004, as well as the upgrade procedure for a Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0 machine, which requires first upgrading to ISA Server 2000 and then to ISA Server 2004. The chapter includes a “Quick Start” section that provides the basics on how to get ISA 2004 up and running as quickly as possible, and instructions on how to create a temporary “all open” outbound access policy to allow the verification that ISA server is working after installation.

AB  - Abstract
Many aspect mining techniques have been proposed for object-oriented systems. Unfortunately, aspect mining for multi-agent systems is an unexplored research area. The inherent specificities of multi-agent systems (such as autonomy, pro-activity, reactivity, and adaptability) make it difficult to understand, reuse and maintain their code. We propose, in this paper, a (semi-automatic) hybrid aspect mining approach for agent-oriented code. The technique is based on both static and dynamic analyzes. The main motivations of this work are (1) identifying cross-cutting concerns in existing agent-oriented code, and (2) making them explicitly available to software engineers involved in the evolution of agent-oriented code in order to facilitate its refactoring and, consequently, to improve its understandability, reusability and maintainability. The proposed approach is supported by a software tool, called MAMIT (MAS Aspect-MIning Tool), that we developed. The approach and the associated tool are illustrated using a concrete case study.

AB  - Abstract
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) security issues have been a major concern for decades. Today's ICT infrastructure faces sophisticated attacks using combinations of multiple vulnerabilities to penetrate networks with devastating impact. With the recent rise of cloud computing as a new utility computing paradigm, organizations have been considering it as a viable option to outsource major IT services in order to cut costs. Some organizations have opted for a private or hybrid cloud to take advantage of the emerging technologies and services. However, ICT security issues have to be appropriately mitigated. This research proposes a cloud security framework and an approach for vulnerabilities coverage and cost optimization using Cuckoo search algorithm with Lévy flights as random walks. The objective is to mitigate an identified set of vulnerabilities using a selected set of techniques when minimizing cost and maximizing coverage. The results show that Cloud Computing providers and organizations implementing cloud technology within their premises can effectively balance IT security coverage and cost using the proposed approach.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter describes how one can connect to and collect nonvolatile and volatile data from Cisco switch devices in response to an attack or intrusion. Before connecting to switches, the initial steps of investigation must involve interviews with the Point of Contact (POC) for the switch, obtain password, set procedures for data collection, and devise the documentation. A Cisco switch can be accessed in many different ways. Depending on how the intrusion has affected the switch, one may have to gain access using a serial console cable, using the switch's Web interface, by Telneting into the switch, or by using a program such as Cisco Network Assistant (CNA). The chapter discusses how volatile and nonvolatile information can be extracted from switches after connecting. The show commands, such as show clock, show run, show vlan, and show mac, allow one to gather volatile information. Setting banners, enabling port security, and following proper password policy gives greater overall security. Logging to a syslog server allows one to greater granularity regarding system events. Analysis of volatile and nonvolatile data gathered from a Cisco switch should answer questions about what happened, what can be done to protection in future, what damage was caused, and who was the attacker.

AB  - The long-term potential benefits through reduction of cost of services and improvement of business outcomes make Cloud Computing an attractive proposition these days. To make it more marketable in the wider IT user community one needs to address a variety of information security risks. In this paper, we present an extensive review on cloud computing with the main focus on gaps and security concerns. We identify the top security threats and their existing solutions. We also investigate the challenges/obstacles in implementing threat remediation. To address these issues, we propose a proactive threat detection model by adopting three main goals: (i) detect an attack when it happens, (ii) alert related parties (system admin, data owner) about the attack type and take combating action, and (iii) generate information on the type of attack by analyzing the pattern (even if the cloud provider attempts subreption). To emphasize the importance of monitoring cyber attacks we provide a brief overview of existing literature on cloud computing security. Then we generate some real cyber attacks that can be detected from performance data in a hypervisor and its guest operating systems. We employ modern machine learning techniques as the core of our model and accumulate a large database by considering the top threats. A variety of model performance measurement tools are applied to verify the model attack prediction capability. We observed that the Support Vector Machine technique from statistical machine learning theory is able to identify the top attacks with an accuracy of 97.13%. We have detected the activities using performance data (CPU, disk, network and memory performance) from the hypervisor and its guest operating systems, which can be generated by any cloud customer using built-in or third party software. Thus, one does not have to depend on cloud providers’ security logs and data. We believe our line of thoughts comprising a series of experiments will give researchers, cloud providers and their customers a useful guide to proactively protect themselves from known or even unknown security issues that follow the same patterns.

AB  - Abstract
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are one of the key foundations of smart grids. The Distributed Network Protocol version 3 (DNP3) is a standard SCADA protocol designed to facilitate communications in substations and smart grid nodes. The protocol is embedded with a security mechanism called Secure Authentication (DNP3-SA). This mechanism ensures that end-to-end communication security is provided in substations. This paper presents a formal model for the behavioural analysis of DNP3-SA using Coloured Petri Nets (CPN). Our DNP3-SA CPN model is capable of testing and verifying various attack scenarios: modification, replay and spoofing, combined complex attack and mitigation strategies. Using the model has revealed a previously unidentified flaw in the DNP3-SA protocol that can be exploited by an attacker that has access to the network interconnecting DNP3 devices. An attacker can launch a successful attack on an outstation without possessing the pre-shared keys by replaying a previously authenticated command with arbitrary parameters. We propose an update to the DNP3-SA protocol that removes the flaw and prevents such attacks. The update is validated and verified using our CPN model proving the effectiveness of the model and importance of the formal protocol analysis.

The traditional Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) are largely inefficient to be deployed in cloud computing environments due to their openness and specific essence. This paper surveys, explores and informs researchers about the latest developed IDPSs and alarm management techniques by providing a comprehensive taxonomy and investigating possible solutions to detect and prevent intrusions in cloud computing systems. Considering the desired characteristics of IDPS and cloud computing systems, a list of germane requirements is identified and four concepts of autonomic computing self-management, ontology, risk management, and fuzzy theory are leveraged to satisfy these requirements.

Systems and network device reporting is important to the overall health and security of systems. This chapter explores finding key events in the log files of Web servers and their host systems, and correlating that data to give useful reports. Further, it discusses different methods of report outputs that will be meaningful to senior management. Modern software applications and Web servers have at least basic logging features. It is in the best interest of organizations to have policies in place that effectively and efficiently manage these logs and collect them appropriately. The policies adopted need to provide the proper storage and management of the log data collected. The chapter examines the file system of the Web server and look for recently created or modified items in the Web root.

A network based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) gathers and analyzes network packets and report possible low level security violations to a system administrator. In a large network setup, these low level and partial reports become unmanageable to the administrator resulting in some unattended events. Further it is known that state of the art IDS generate many false alarms. There are techniques proposed in IDS literature to minimize false alarms, many of which are widely used in practice in commercial Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools. In this paper, we review existing false alarm minimization techniques in signature-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). We give a taxonomy of false alarm minimization techniques in signature-based IDS and present the pros and cons of each class. We also study few of the prominent commercial SIEM tools which have implemented these techniques along with their performance. Finally, we conclude with some directions to the future research.

AB  - Operating a cloud securely and efficiently requires substantial advance planning—in terms of the data center and redundant Internet connections that attach to the cloud ingress, the massive amount of gear that is racked and cabled following patterns, the infrastructure that manages the cloud and its resources as it operates, and even the individual server, storage, and network components comprising the system. Failing to plan appropriately can result in higher ongoing costs and operations that cannot meet the time-domain needs of managing a highly dynamic cloud. But what constitutes appropriate planning? This chapter takes a close look at the architectural components that can be used to build a cloud with an eye on security. In addition to identifying the architectural requirements of a secure cloud, along with key patterns and architectural elements, the chapter also discusses several different cloud architectures and key strategies for secure operation.

AB  - Recent reports by major health institutions have shown that up to one half of patients do not take their medications as prescribed, which undermines treatment outcomes and increases the costs of healthcare. The implantation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) is seen as a key step in all the strategies envisaged to address this problem, and there are several major initiatives to standardize such artifacts. In this paper, we present a system that aims to promote medication adherence in contexts of daily life, interacting with standards-based EHR repositories from both domestic and mobile devices. This approach represents an advance with regard to previous works on smart medicine managers, which could only record information in local logs and required the users to enter their prescriptions and medications regimens manually. Experiments with real users confirm the added value of applications with automatic access to EHR and interfaces for various types of devices.

Each investigation undertaken is different from the last, much like snowflakes. However, some basic concepts can be common across investigations, and knowing where to look for corroborating information can be an important key. Too often it might be tugged or driven by external forces and deadlines, and knowing where to look for information or evidence of activity, beyond what is presented by forensic “analysis” graphical user interface (GUI), is very important. Many investigations are limited because of time and resources for merely a search for keywords or specific files, whereas there could be a great deal of information available if only we knew where to look and what questions to ask. Knowing where to look and where evidence should exist based on how the operating system and applications respond to user action are both very important aspects of forensic analysis. Knowing where log files should exist as well as their format can provide valuable clues during an investigation, perhaps more so if those artifacts are absent. A lack of clear documentation of various file formats is a challenge for forensic investigations. The key to overcome this challenge is thorough, documented investigation of these file formats and sharing of this information. This includes not only files and file formats from versions of the Windows operating system currently being investigated but also newer versions, such as Vista.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses several solutions for data management in Windows 2000. Managing data in Windows 2000 involves data compression, setting disk quotas, data encryption, and disk defragmentation. Data compression decreases the amount of disk space required for file storage. Compression can be performed on files, folders, or whole NT file system (NTFS) volumes. Disk quotas are used to manage the growth and size of file storage for each user or groups of users. They help in allocating disk space for each user or groups of users (credit limits) and ensure that they do not go over that limit or quota. Like compression, disk quotas can only be used with the NTFS. Data encryption ensures that data is not viewed by the wrong users. EFS is the acronym for the Windows 2000 Encrypting File System. It allows users to encrypt data in selected NTFS files and folders so that it can be stored securely on the computer. Using EFS, users can encrypt, decrypt, access, move, copy, and rename their files. Windows 2000 disk defragmenter can be used to defragment the files on the hard disks periodically. This consolidates all the pieces of the flies into a single space on the hard drive so that the computer can access the files more quickly and efficiently. Disk defragmentation speeds up the processor time of the computer.

AB  - Using XML as a data representation format is a common choice when integrating software systems on different platforms. The serialization of in-memory object instances of a class into corresponding XML documents heavily influences the performance of the XML-based communication, even if we send the XML over HTTP as in the case of SOAP-based XML Web Services, or with asynchronous messaging such as Java Message Service (JMS), or simply saving it into a file. Several studies have been published analyzing the performance impact of XML serialization on different platforms. No models or measurement methodologies have been proposed however, to establish a relationship between the serialization cost of primitive types (e.g. int, double, string), and the serialization cost of composite types. Such a model can be very useful when the type of the XML messages exchanged during the communication are known a priori, recorded in an interface definition, similarly to the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) in case of XML Web Services. This paper introduces a model that is validated with measurements on .NET and Java platform. The opposite direction, deserialization is covered as well. The main mathematical tool used is linear regression, but cases are also shown and explained where linearity is compromised.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Several best practices in information management must be followed in order to deal with massive volumes of log and event data that can result from monitoring established network enclaves, and the challenges of highly distributed and segregated enclaves. Assets—the physical devices within the network—provide security data, typically in the form of logs. Assets can produce logs that track activity on a variety of levels: the operating system itself produces many logs, including system logs, application logs, and file system logs. System logs are useful for tracking the status of devices and the services that are or are not running, as well as when patches are (or are not) applied. Logs are useful for determining the general health of an asset as well as the validation that approved ports and services are running. Configuration monitoring refers to the process of monitoring baseline configurations for any indications of change, and is only a small part of Configuration Management. Basic configuration monitoring can be done at a rudimentary level through a combination of host configuration file monitoring (to establish the baseline), system and application log monitoring (to look for change actions), and file integrity monitoring.

AB  - Authentication ensures that system's resources are not obtained fraudulently by illegal users. Password authentication is one of the simplest and the most convenient authentication mechanisms over insecure networks. The problem of password authentication in an insecure networks is present in many application areas. Since computing resources have grown tremendously, password authentication is more frequently required in areas such as computer networks, wireless networks, remote login, operation systems, and database management systems. Many schemes based on cryptography have been proposed to solve the problem. However, previous schemes are vulnerable to various attacks and are neither efficient, nor user friendly. Users cannot choose and change their passwords at will. In this paper, we propose a new password authentication scheme to achieve the all proposed requirements. Furthermore, our scheme can support the Diffie–Hellman key agreement protocol over insecure networks. Users and the system can use the agreed session key to encrypt/decrypt their communicated messages using the symmetric cryptosystem.

AB  - Publisher Summary
One key element in obtaining evidence of cybercrimes may be found by enabling auditing of suspicious events in the boundary devices and operating systems that are likely to be subject to attack. IT professionals should understand how to instruct these systems and devices to log such data and should also be aware of what kinds and classes of events are most worth logging. These events include logon attempts, access to sensitive resources, use of administrative privileges, and monitoring of key system and data files. Law enforcement professionals should be aware not only that these logs exist, but also that they often provide the most salient evidence of attempted or successful cybercrimes, and they must be aware of how to make appropriate efforts to secure and protect these logs before and during the investigation. Firewalls, routers, proxy servers, network servers, and IDSes can all contribute logs (plus related reports, alarms, and alerts) to substantiate allegations that unauthorized access, alteration, destruction, or denial of service occurred for information assets or services and to help track down the origin of the activity. In the security model known as triple-A (authentication, authorization, and accounting), accounting is what makes auditing and logging of suspicious or illicit activity possible. IT and law enforcement professionals alike must understand this concept. On the proactive, preventive side of system and network security, boundary systems and servers should be configured to prevent or deflect common known attacks while also auditing and logging any evidence that related activities may be occurring.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter highlights the uses of monitoring activities in Internet information services (IIS) focusing on indentifying possible unauthorized access and recognizing potential attach hints using that various IIS server log files. Logging site activities helps to keep track of client access requests. This type of log provides the details about who, when, where, and how contents are being accessed. Information that can be logged includes the visitor's Internet protocol (IP) address, the user account accessing the contents, a timestamp of when requests were made, the server status reply to the request, the requested resource location, and the amount of bytes used in the request. These log files also provide a good troubleshooting channel to resolve any failure or error request, and can provide clues about possible attacker behavior and intrusion patterns. Event viewer is another log source that records related service events in IIS and Windows operating systems. These events can be logged in three different categories such as system, security, and application. If IIS server is configured as an active directory domain controller (DC) and domain name server (DNS), additional log types in the event viewer can be seen. The directory server and file replication service logs are related to active directory operation events, and the DNS server log captures domain name zone-related events. The chapter closes with a discussion on monitoring HTTP application programming interface (API) error log, and uses of URLScan.

AB  - In our modern information age, recent technical developments and trends, such as mobile and pervasive computing, cloud computing, and Web 2.0 applications, increasingly pose privacy dilemmas. Due to the low costs and technical advances of storage technologies, masses of personal data can easily be stored. Once disclosed, these data may be retained forever, often without the knowledge of the individuals concerned, and be removed with difficulty. Hence, it has become hard for individuals to manage and control their personal spheres. Both legal and technical means are needed to protect privacy and to (re)establish the individuals’ control. This chapter provides an overview to the area of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), which help to protect privacy by technically enforcing legal privacy principles. It will start with defining the legal foundations of PETs and will present a classification of PETs as well as a definition of traditional privacy properties that PETs are addressing and metrics for measuring the level of privacy that PETs are providing. Then, a selection of the most relevant PETs is presented.

It is critical to gain intelligence and insight on your log data. Techniques will be presented in this chapter which will help you analyze your log data with an eye toward automated log review. But what do you do once you have discovered something? The next step in the process is taking action, usually in the form of alerting and response. These topics and more will be discussed in this chapter. At the end of this chapter you will better understand the concepts surrounding filtering, parsing, and correlation and be able to apply them to your own situation.

This chapter focuses on capturing live network forensics data. The network for which the network forensics is performed uses Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), therefore it is vitally important that the organization records and preserves the DHCP logs for the period of time being examined. The DHCP log entry provides a way to physically locate the computer within the network. These logs describe which device issues the Internet Protocol address to a computer with a specific Mac address. The switch logs can divulge which switch port is used. Wireshark® is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer. It has a rich and powerful feature set and runs on most computing platforms including Windows, OS X, Linux, and UNIX. Network professionals, security experts, developers, and educators around the world use it regularly. It is freely available as an open source, and is released under the GNU General Public License version 2. The Wireshark users manual mentions that Wireshark is a network packet analyzer that can be used to try to capture network packets and to display that packet data. Wireshark can be used to troubleshoot network problems, examine security problems, debug protocol implementations, and learn network protocol internals.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter reveals that the maintenance of system to sustain its reliability and performance is a crucial factor in the usage of Windows XP, as it is for every operating system (OS). To assist in this task, Windows XP comes with a set of system tools. After one installs scratch or upgrade previous OS, which is not advised, the first system tool that one should use is disk cleaning, to get rid of temporary files and other reminisces of the installation/upgrade. Adding files and subsequently removing them introduces disk fragmentation, which can spiral out of control, slowly decreasing the system's performance if it is not controlled. To curb this behavior, disk defragmenter, which reduces the defragmentation of files to virtually none, additionally trying to group the free disk space, can be used. Once the system has been installed, two paths can be pursued and either will lead to the same goal: a finalized Windows XP system ready for use.

The auditing process breaks down into a couple of categories: Windows 2000/2003 event auditing and Exchange 2000/2003 diagnostics logging. This chapter examines the following topics: Windows 2000/2003 auditing, auditing changes to the Exchange configuration, exchange diagnostics logging, and Microsoft Operations Manager and Exchange 2003. It presents information on some of the options in regard to auditing Windows 2000/2003 and the Exchange 2000/2003 systems.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter presents the workflow of a typical virus infection or botnet security incident describing the various repositories of potential evidence, and the tools used to find and extract them. Many virus infections or bot client cases start as potential computer crime cases until one could determine the potential damage or intent. Most organizations have started using first responder tools. The first responder tool, Rapid Assessment and Potential Incident Examination Report (RAPIER), is adapted from a tool that is used by Intel to collect a consistent set of data from a machine involved in an incident, no matter where in the world the incident had occurred and regardless of the skill of the first responder. RAPIER enables investigators to have the desktop support techs gather the information as part of normal response to suspected bot clients or virus-infected systems. Investigators are also able to determine the identity of other infected machines by examining security event and firewall logs. RAPIER has the ability to identify a forensics server. Each client can be configured to send its result to the forensics server across the network. Analysis of these logs may indicate a need for deeper forensics. RAPIER requires the presence of .NET 2.0, so it is well suited to a corporate environment in which .NET 2.0 is deployed by policy and less suited for a less-regulated environment.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the firewall reporting. Firewall logs provide valuable information about potential violations of security policies. These logs need to be reviewed frequently. Reporting firewall activity serves several purposes. First, it gives security administrators an overview of what is currently happening on all the networks and firewalls for which they are responsible. The second purpose is to understand what kinds of activity are typical for a given firewall and how that activity changes over time. Armed with the knowledge of what is typical, the security administrator can quickly spot something new happening (such as a new worm) and can quickly react to adjust the firewalls if necessary. To handle the reporting requirements, the firewall logs must be automatically digested and summarized on a regular basis. The supporting services for firewall log management require a syslog server, a database server, and a Web server. fwlogwatch is useful for generating a tabular (text or HTML) summary of firewall log events. Statistics by country of origin for log events can be determined by extracting the source Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from the database and using the GeoIP library to resolve the country.

AB  - Managing all the information flooding from your network, security devices, and products can be a full-time job. Firewalls, anti-virus, IDS, and proxy servers are constantly logging data even when your systems are not under attack. The main purpose of these devices is to defend against and stop attacks, but the tidal wave of information coming from all these systems can make it very difficult to pick out a signal from the noise and distinguish between an attack, a system malfunction, and mere everyday traffic.

AB  - While compliance requirements drive many small and medium businesses to Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) products, the complexity of traditional SIEM may frustrate many SMEs. SMEs invariably lack the large security staff (who are typically found in larger enterprises) needed for deployment, configuration, monitoring and reporting of SIEM solutions. And you need to add to that the fact that it's often not just a SIEM that is needed to meet compliance requirements – asset detection and inventory, intrusion detection systems (IDS), host IDS, file integrity monitoring and vulnerability scanning are also necessary.

While compliance requirements drive many small and medium businesses to Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) products, the complexity of traditional SIEM may frustrate many SMEs.

Patrick Bedwell of AlienVault looks at the technical underpinnings of SIEM and log management, highlighting the problems with traditional SIEM for SMEs, and explaining how unified security management can provide the security and compliance capabilities SMEs need, while keeping in mind the significant budgetary and resource constraints typical of these smaller organisations.

AB  - A fundamental requirement for the healthcare industry is that the delivery of care comes first and nothing should interfere with it. As a consequence, the access control mechanisms used in healthcare to regulate and restrict the disclosure of data are often bypassed in case of emergencies. This phenomenon, called “break the glass”, is a common pattern in healthcare organizations and, though quite useful and mandatory in emergency situations, from a security perspective, it represents a serious system weakness. Malicious users, in fact, can abuse the system by exploiting the break the glass principle to gain unauthorized privileges and accesses.

In this paper, we propose an access control solution aimed at better regulating break the glass exceptions that occur in healthcare systems. Our solution is based on the definition of different policy spaces, a language, and a composition algebra to regulate access to patient data and to balance the rigorous nature of traditional access control systems with the “delivery of care comes first” principle.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses system control. System control facilities provide for the protection of the database, the smooth operation of applications that use the database and the database management system (DBMS), and the effective use of the DBMS. DBMS installation and maintenance facilities enables the generation of special run-time versions that favor certain types of update or retrieval processing. The more resources expended during the update operations in preparation for database recovery, the quicker and less expensive is the recovery. A dynamic relationship DBMS only locks a single data record type and its associated instances as they alone are contained in a single O/S file. If the database application is implemented with a static relationship DBMS, logical database changes always consume more resources to incorporate than do changes to a dynamic relationship DBMS. Physical reorganization is process to bring the physical order of the database back into close relationship with its implied logical order. If a run-unit accesses data from multiple databases, then a host language interface run-unit can produce the consolidated report.

These paths often utilize mixtures of protocols and devices (such as modems, multiplexors, switches and front-ends) from multiple vendors. The talk describes how the data can be gathered from these devices and protocol layers, consolidated, stored, and analyzed. The analysis typically includes merging information from data bases describing the network topology, components, etc. Examples of reports and displays of the information gleaned are shown, together with illustrations of how the information may be useful for troubleshooting, performance measurement, auditing, accounting, and trend prediction.

AB  - Abstract
Conventional passive database management systems are inadequate for time-constrained applications, because they either do not provide timely response to critical situations or compromise modularity. Active database management systems attempt to provide both modularity and timely response, by allowing event-condition-action rules to be specified declaratively; when events of interest occur, they efficiently evaluate the corresponding conditions, and if these conditions are satisfied, they trigger the corresponding actions. The development of active database management systems requires the solution of a number of research problems in the areas of knowledge modelling, execution modelling, condition monitoring, scheduling, system architecture, and performance evaluation. This paper describes the principal research issues in each of these areas, surveys the approaches being taken in a number of research projects on active DBMSs, and emphasizes the approaches we are taking in the HiPAC (High Performance ACtive DBMS) project.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Monitoring and testing are capable of inflating payment card industry (PCI) compliance costs to the point of consuming the small margins of card transactions. A PCI compliant operating environment is where the cardholder data exists. Because of auditable logging, the data can never go out of that environment. Any successful operating environment is designed from the ground up, or in the case of a networking infrastructure and applications space, from the wires on up. Good monitoring systems—event management and network-intrusion prevention—and forensic investigation tools rely on time. It is best to break up the task of monitoring and logging into two less daunting components. It is imperative that the activity that is being performed does not interfere with the primary job of the components that are being monitored. These primary jobs include providing services to merchants, serving up cardholder information to a point of sale, and providing services to a financial institution. Infrastructure, because it does not have a good sense of what's happening at the applications layer, is an ideal place for a hacker to set up camp and search for sellable data. Applications that have been developed by small coding houses will need customization for being monitored.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter introduces various sources and potential types of evidence that investigators can gather to provide evidence of attempts to perpetrate cybercrimes. In some cases, this evidence may be collected whether the attempted crime succeeds or fails; in other cases, such evidence may only be available as a byproduct of a successful attack. To some extent, computers and other network devices are capable of recording information about activity that occurs within them or passes through them. When evidence of cybercrime is needed, this kind of data can be an essential element in making a successful case or in making a decision to prosecute the people responsible. But as with so many other aspects of system and network security, it is necessary to understand the underlying technologies and software that must be put to work to make it possible to produce such evidence. One key element in obtaining evidence of cybercrimes may be found by enabling auditing of suspicious events in the boundary devices and operating systems that are likely to be subject to attack. IT professionals should understand how to instruct these systems and devices to log such data, and should also be aware of what kinds and classes of events are most worth logging. These events include logon attempts, access to sensitive resources, use of administrative privileges, and monitoring of key system and data files.

It is important for any network administrator to have a good understanding of the tools available to monitor, manage, and troubleshoot the network for which he or she may be responsible. This chapter introduces some tools in Server 2008 that helps to monitor and manage networks easily. It also discusses setting up and using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to ensure that servers and workstations remain properly updated with the latest security fixes from Microsoft. WSUS is installed on a server in your corporate network. This server contacts Microsoft update servers over the Internet to download new updates. The WSUS administrator then must approve or deny updates that should be installed. Corporate servers and workstations are configured to download updates from the WSUS server instead of the Windows Update Web site. This chapter also highlights collecting and using performance data as well as review event logs to assist one in troubleshooting problems. Finally, the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), and Network Monitor (netmon) is also explained.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter deals with attacking the problem of botnets. It reviews the various ways that respond to the challenge of botnets, including the basic security practices for hosts and networks. If a botnet client host is vulnerable to exploitation and not fixed, it is still vulnerable and can probably be infected with a new bug—controlled by a different master, and added to a new, stealthier botnet for new forms of misuse. The primary motivation for the creation and use of botnets is money. Education about keeping computers safe has always been a problem in security. Several effective practices for individual computer users to consider are: if it's spam, delete it and don't respond to it, do not execute unknown e-mail attachments, make sure the system has auto-updates on, and ensure that the local accounts—particularly those with administrator privileges have strong passwords. If one is in an enterprise or organization, one should consider a software that will centrally collect and protect the local event logs from the workstations.

AB  - Properties such as logging, persistence, debugging, tracing, distribution, performance monitoring and exception handling occur in most programming paradigms and are normally very difficult or even impossible to modularize with traditional modularization mechanisms because they are cross-cutting. Recently, aspect-oriented programming has enjoyed recognition as a practical solution for separating these concerns. In this paper we describe an extension to the Stratego term rewriting language for capturing such properties. We show our aspect language offers a concise, practical and adaptable solution for dealing with unanticipated algorithm extension for forward data-flow propagation and dynamic type checking of terms. We briefly discuss some of the challenges faced when designing and implementing an aspect extension for and in a rule-based term rewriting system.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Securing data on a network is one of several elements in an overall security plan. Controlling access to files, folders, and other resources is the second line of defense next to a strong user authentication strategy. Through the use of access control lists (ACLs), users can be granted access via groups to needed resources. The chapter discusses that auditing events provide an additional measure of security and visibility. Auditing activities include monitoring logon, account use, privilege user, object access, and more. Determining appropriate auditing events and reviewing auditing logs can be improved. With encrypted file system (EFS), folders and files can be encrypted in a manner completely transparent to the user. When EFS is implemented, it will use the user's certificate if one exists or will request from a certificate authority (CA), if available. The cipher.exe command can be used to encrypt and decrypt individual files and folders as well as to create recovery agents and other activities related to file and folder encryption. Backup and recovery must also be performed in a secure manner, including securing backup media in secure and access-controlled locations, making multiple backup sets and storing one set off-site, splitting permissions for backup and restore between trusted users or groups to prevent one user from having permission to both backup and restore data and monitoring all backup and restore activities.

AB  - Publisher Summary
There are several cyber security standards and regulations imposed by governments and industry, which provide everything from “best practices” recommendations to hard requirements that are enforced through penalties and fines. Some common standards are the North American Electric Reliability Corporation's (NERC's) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards, the US Department of Homeland Security's Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS), and the Regulated Security of Nuclear Facilities by the United States. The Risk-Based Performance Standards (RBPS) for the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) outlines various controls for securing the cyber systems of chemical facilities. Specifically, RBPS Metric 8 (“Cyber”) outlines controls for security policies, access control, personnel security, awareness and training, monitoring and incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity, system development and acquisition, configuration management, and audits. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Regulation 5.71 (RG 5.71) provides security recommendations for complying with Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 73.54. It consists of an in-depth discussion of the general requirements of cyber security, to specific requirements of planning, establishing, and implementing a cyber security program.

An access control strategy is the building block on which one can start designing directory services structure because it determines the overall strategy that is followed in implementing security throughout the directory. There are two strategies that need to strike a balance. They are: access and control. Access means the user will build his or her directory security with easy accessibility in mind, focusing more on accommodating access than tightening security. Control implies that the user grants the least permissions possible and would then move on to relaxing permissions as the need arises. This approach maintains system integrity and security as its top priority. It also discusses that to implement a security strategy on files, folders, and directory objects, users need to enlist the help of access control lists (ACLs) that determine as to who has access to resources and how much access a given user has. ACLs comprise two layers of security—new technology file system (NTFS) security and share security. NTFS security is implemented on the actual object, whereas share security is used when this resource is accessed over the network. Restricted groups greatly enhance security because it gives the user a mechanism to enforce user memberships to sensitive groups. A good password policy can ensure that a system is not vulnerable to easy password attacks by hackers.

AB  - Access control is the basis for all security disciplines, not just IT security. The purpose of access control is to allow authorized users access to appropriate data and deny access to unauthorized users. Seems simple, right? It would be easy to completely lock a system down to allow just predefined actions with no room for leeway. In fact, many organizations, including the U.S. military, are doing just that; restricting the access users have to systems to a very small functional capability.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter elaborates on information on securing Windows 2000/IIS servers. The user should focus on securing server environments as multi-layered system. The first layer/step is to set up perimeter—that means firewalls and routers. Firewalls and routers equipped to handle denial of service attacks should be used. Disabling ports and protocols at the public door to network is the best way to prevent unwanted traffic on network. It also enables the use of some of these protocols—such as NetBIOS—on the internal network without the fear of the various transmission control protocol/user datagram protocol attacks on systems. The next step is to physically lock down the servers. Controlling physical access to the machine circumvents all offline access attacks. The most prevalent of these are system accounts database (SAM) attacks, where hackers locally log on to an operating system other than Windows 2000 and access new technology file system to either crack or delete the SAM database, and/or accessing the Registry files in the repair directory.

This chapter examines locking down the XenApp server and the ways to protect assets from risks. It clarifies that servers need certain configurations to provide security, and the plans must be put into practice. It provides the process of locking down system BIOS. The chapter shows that how by implementing a password on server's system BIOS, one can add another preventative measure in overall security plan. By using USB blockers, one can prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to unnecessary resources. The best security policies can be adopted and implemented in the latest software. The issues surrounding the protection of the data are discussed in this chapter, which majorly include: the definitions of business continuity planning (BCP) and disaster recovery (DR) Planning, and how the two processes are closely tied together.

AB  - Publisher Summary
The chapter discusses the basic diligence efforts needed to keep a security program healthy. The purpose of a security audit is to assess the quantity of risk and the effectiveness of the organization's risk management processes as they relate to the security measures instituted to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and to instill accountability for the actions taken on the organization's systems. Information security is the process by which an organization protects and secures systems and media, facilities that process, and maintains information vital to its operations. The security of systems and information is essential for the privacy of organizational and corporate customer information. Security professionals must maintain effective security programs adequate for their organization's operational complexity. These security programs must have a strong board and senior-management-level support, integration of security responsibilities and controls throughout the organization's business processes, and clear accountability for carrying out security responsibilities. The chapter provides guidance to security professionals and organizations on determining the level of security risks to the organization and evaluating the adequacy of the organization's risk management.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the SSH server advanced uses. SSH can provide a valuable tool for secure remote access. There are many tools provided by the operating system for securing SSH server. Between a local firewall, TCP Wrappers, and customizing syslog configuration, SSH server can be well protected. Except for these OS-level access control mechanisms, the SSH server itself offers an impressive array of customization and security options. Securing SSH server is the most important part of getting the server up and running. After all, having a non-working SSH implementation will not usually result in a compromised system, while having an insecure implementation of the SSH server running almost certainly will. Another important consideration for the SSH server is the system time. Configuring SSH server to use Network Time Protocol (NTP) to keep the system clock accurate is very easy.

A variety of tools are available for use in cyber warfare, penetration testing, and security in general. And most of them are free (or have free versions) and are available to the general public. For instance, reconnaissance tools can gather general information, search whois and DNS records, and search metadata from media and documents. Scanning tools, such as Nmap and Nessus, can find systems and detect areas where vulnerabilities might exist. Access and privilege escalation tools, such as Metasploit and CANVAS, can penetrate system accounts. Exfiltration tools can encrypt, hide, or smuggle data over common protocols to remove them from a compromised system. Backdoors can sustain a connection to a compromised system. Assault tools can damage or disrupt compromised systems. And obfuscation tools can hide one’s location, logically and physically, during an attack. This chapter discusses how to use these tools and how to defend against an attacker using them.

This chapter describes the process of continuous monitoring, one of the primary operational security activities for systems once they are authorized to operate and put into production. This description includes details on the process and expectations in the Risk Management Framework for monitoring security controls implemented for information systems, and the system- and agency-level continuous monitoring functions required under current federal guidance. Federal agencies increasingly develop and use continuous monitoring strategies that apply across multiple or all information systems, so while system-specific monitoring plans and operational procedures remain important, this chapter explains the relationship between system- and agency-level continuous monitoring activities and highlights some of the opportunities for system owners and agencies that implement effective continuous monitoring programs.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the use of security templates in Windows Server 2003 as a way to apply consistent security settings to an entire network or to a subset of computers or servers. The chapter also focuses on the deployment of these templates across an entire network in an efficient manner and the use of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and scripting techniques to quickly deploy common security settings across an entire network. Windows Server 2003 provides new security tools and features that differ significantly from previous Windows Server products. Windows Server 2003 is installed in a locked-down state providing the fewest services and permissions possible while still providing standard functionality. The improved security tools make configuring, analyzing, troubleshooting, and maintaining security easier. Using Security Extensions to Group Policy is the easiest way to apply a security template or any set of security policies to various GPOs. The best security practices, especially with regard to servers, include securing the computer in an access-controlled location to physically prevent unauthorized access. Additional security measures can be taken depending on the role of the server.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter focuses on security of the network-connected resources, such as servers and workstations. Many times theorganization looks only at securing its perimeter, while leaving its interior network open and unprotected. This hard-exterior-soft-squishy-interior approach is better than no security, but it is not the best approach. The best approach is through defense in depth, which is the practice of applying security measures at all levels of the network. Many security solutions are available for protecting network resources. Basic hardening should be performed on all network resources, from workstations, to servers, to routers, and switches. After basic hardening, regular patches and updates are required to ensure running the most secure software possible. Personal firewalls can serve as the first line of defense, providing logical access control based on the contents of network packets. After the network is secured, the defenses turn inward, to protect assets from viruses and spyware. The chapter concludes by suggesting file encryption to protect sensitive data even if the system or encrypted files should fall into the wrong hands.

Access control is performed by implementing strong technical, physical, and administrative measures. This chapter also defines the CIA triads that are comprised of protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability. All three pieces work together to provide assurance that data and systems remain secure. It should not assume that one part of the triad is more important than another. Every IT system will require a different prioritization of the three, depending on the data, user community, and timeliness required for accessing the data.

This chapter is based on questions from organizations that have deployed ESM. They have either deployed ESM with a focus on security, compliance, or both, and are interested in also addressing insider threats. They are from a cross-industry, cross-geography composite of large enterprise and government organizations. This book has narrowed their questions to the ten most common. These are not stack ranked; instead they follow a consistent methodology based on an organization's thought process about the problem, from people and process requirements to common technical concerns, and more creative requests. The chapter states that politics differ, sensitivity of information is not equal, risk profiles are never consistent, budgets are rarely similar, and security programs always have different levels of maturity. It should be kept in mind during evaluation of needs against these top ten questions and answers. Although this chapter is directly based on questions from organizations, not a single organization considered all ten items critical for its environment. .

This chapter reviews many of the new security features included with Windows Server 2008 R2. Microsoft has made a concerted effort to build components into their product to assist administrators in securing their environments. Many of the features reviewed assist directly with security and compliance, such as the new auditing components and the FCI. In addition, AppLocker is explained; it is a new feature that allows administrators to focus on client-side software restrictions. The first step in configuring AppLocker involves determining what applications to control. Depending on the environment, the need to restrict applications can come from very different places. Server Core is a Windows Server installation model that Microsoft introduced with Windows 2008. The basic principle of Server Core revolves around the concept of minimizing the attack surface area. Removing unnecessary feature sets and roles and additionally locking down the ones that are required limit an attacker’s capability to exploit a particular system.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Enterprise Security Management (ESM) is defined simply as the process of controlling configuration, deployment, and monitoring of security policies across heterogeneous platforms and disparate security products. This chapter discusses what ESM is, how it works, and when and where it should be used. In some cases, ESM is not necessary, and in others, it is mandatory. In addition, it discusses some features of ESM and how it can make a job easier and effective. Lastly, it discusses some ESM tools currently available in the market. It examines each component of ESM and defines exactly what is involved in this process. The information presented in this chapter helps in deciding whether ESM is fit for an organization or not, and helps in implementation of this process. The most common cause for the need of ESM is the existence of security problems and threats. The need to protect an organization and its assets drive the need for security in general. The process of ESM includes more than just examining data from systems. Again, ESM is the process of controlling configuration, deployment, and monitoring of security policies across heterogeneous platforms and disparate security products.

This chapter provides an overview of the process of securing a Windows Server 2003 enterprise network. The chapter examines how to analyze a company's business requirements for network and data security. This analysis includes looking at the existing security policies and procedures to either incorporate them into a new security design or determine the kinds of changes they would need to work within a Windows Server 2003 network. After determining the organization's security needs, the next step is to determine what types of attacks the network will be subjected to. The chapter deals with many of the common attacks that an enterprise network faces as large Internet-based attacks spread quickly and multiply at an unbelievable rate. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the interoperability concerns and the challenges created by the integration of down-level or third-party operating systems and services into a Windows Server 2003 network.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the benefits of integrating video surveillance and monitoring (VSAM) technology with an Enterprise Security Management (ESM) platform. The use cases we describe in this chapter focus on an attempted compromise of a critical data center server residing behind the walls of a secure campus. For the purposes of detail, we are dealing with a large fabrication facility, known as ArcNet, which produces computer components. Instead of just detecting the perpetrator sneaking into the data center and attempting to compromise a system, we will examine the entire scenario—from the perimeter breach, to a tailgating violation, to the perpertrator gaining access to not only the facility, but also the secure data center. Once inside the data center, the attacker accesses a terminal and proceeds to guess administrator and root passwords on multiple systems. This is known as a brute force login attempt. The attacker continues to guess passwords that seem obvious, hoping to get lucky (granted, this is a simple atrack, but you may be surprised how many systems are left with default user accounts and passwords). the use case focuses on detection, as well as on a closed-loop process that identifies the perpetrator, automatically takes as snapshot, and adds the resulting picture to a case or trouble ticket as part of the workflow process. The integration with VSAM in this use case is bidirectional. Not only does the video analytics software forward alerts to the ESM platform, but also the ESM system communicates back to the analytics application, instructing it to take a snapshot at the time a violation is detected.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter focuses on the steps that one needs to consider when planning, designing, and building a Windows rooted public key infrastructure (PKI). A PKI is an infrastructure, and many Windows applications can take advantage of it by providing strong security services to their users. Among these applications are networking systems, VPN systems, ERP software, document signing, and smart card-based applications. A PKI project can be split into four key phases: assessment, design, implementation, and management. During the implementation phase, for example, issues may arise that require a new assessment and changes to the original design. During the assessment phase, the current and future security requirements of an organization are analyzed. It can be done by running a security audit, performing a penetration test, or just analyzing existing processes. The assessment phase also includes a business requirement analysis. The design phase deals with the technological and non-technological design of the PKI solution. The implementation phase takes care of the rollout of the PKI solution, its integration with the existing IT environment, and, before the rollout, the development of customized PKI-enabled applications or PKI software plug-ins. In the management phase, one must set up the support model for the PKI, PKI administrator, and user training and the management of the PKI components.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Window's XP Professional has significant modifications over its predecessor Microsoft platform releases. New XP features include offline Web page viewing, dual dynamical link library (DLL) support, built-in wireless support, and an enhanced version of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Multiple other security-related defense tools have also been implemented. The few XP-specific attacks that have been released focus more upon Internet Explorer 6.0 and the new scripting functionality rather than the operating system (OS) itself. Securing Windows XP is cumbersome initially but the tools implemented for the end user to maintain an acceptable level of security are easy to use and effective. The automated update wizard allows for automated critical security-related updates to be automatically downloaded and installed on a daily basis while the Software Restriction Policy engine is a good addition that proactively secures XP against application-layer threats. The combination of additional tools, built-in functionality, and papers documenting best-of-breed security guidelines and practices are constantly improving.

AB  - Abstract
Models have been widely used in the information system development process. Models are not just means for system analysis and documentation. They may be also transformed into system implementation, primarily program code. Generated program code of screen forms and transaction programs mainly implements generic functionalities that can be expressed by simple retrieval, insertion, update, or deletion operations over database records. Besides the program code of generic functionalities, each application usually includes program code for specific business logic that represents application-specific functionalities, which may include complex calculations, as well as a series of database operations. There is a lack of domain-specific and tool-supported techniques for specification of such application-specific functionalities at the level of platform-independent models (PIMs). In this paper, we propose an approach and a domain-specific language (DSL), named IIS?CFuncLang, aimed at enabling a complete specification of application-specific functionalities at the PIM level. We have developed algorithms for transformation of IIS?CFuncLang specifications into executable program code, such as PL/SQL program code. In order to support specification of application-specific functionalities using IIS?CFuncLang, we have also developed appropriate tree-based and textual editors. The language, editors, and the transformations are embedded into a Model-Driven Software Development tool, named Integrated Information Systems CASE (IIS?Case). IIS?Case supports platform-independent design and automated prototyping of information systems, which allows us to verify and test our approach in practice.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the various threats to exchange security and the available countermeasures. This will have a definite impact on the overall design of the organization's security infrastructure. The data and services in the infrastructure must be available for the people and business processes that rely on them. Unsuspecting users may inadvertently execute programs they receive in email. These programs infect systems and cause enormous amounts of damage that cost organizations dearly. The data on the Exchange server and other servers must be maintained in such a manner that no one can gain unauthorized access to the information. An attacker forging messages to appear as if they came from someone or somewhere else can spread false information throughout an organization or, in worse cases, trick users into releasing sensitive information. The Windows Server security features that impact Exchange can be loosely categorized into two key areas of Windows authentication and authorization Windows Services security. Careful research, planning, pilot testing, and deployment of rock-solid security measures will help ensure that the Exchange deployment provides maximum reliability.

AB  - Separation of concerns is an important principle for designing high quality software systems and is both applied in the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) and Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD). The AOSD and MDA techniques seem to be complementary to each other; historically AOSD has focused on modeling crosscutting concerns whereas MDA has focused on the explicit separation of platform independent concerns from platform specific concerns and the model-driven generation processes. In order to assess the benefits of AOSD for MDA we provide a systematic analysis on crosscutting concerns within the MDA context. The analysis consists of three steps. First, we define an abstract model of MDA transformation with respect to concerns. Second, we define a number of evolution scenarios that correspond to a selected list of crosscutting concerns. Third, we analyze the model transformations in MDA with respect to the abstract model, the evolution scenarios and the related crosscutting concerns. This analysis results in the definition of a number of key problems related to the integration and evolution of crosscutting concerns in the MDA approach. Based on this analysis we provide a set of recommendations for the language and the process that is used in the MDA approach.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter covers all of the aspects of reconnaissance and explores how an individual, a company, or an organization can protect against attackers scoping out their assets. Reconnaissance is the ability to quietly locate a target that would be worth attacking. Performing an attack (either physical or virtual) on a company is a very risky process. There are many angles of defeat for the attackers unless they have a bulletproof plan. In many instances, an insider within the target company can provide copious amounts of information to help with the attack, even unknowingly. Google Hacking relies on certain keywords or phrases that only exist within Web sites that are running vulnerable software. It also targets keywords of sensitive data itself, such as credit card numbers and social security numbers. Once an attacker chooses a target, he or she will use every piece of publicly available information to gather as many details as possible about the target's physical location, network capabilities, and employee staff. All of these items can be used later in the attack process. An attacker will use every possible physical resource at their disposal to survey their targets, even public webcams and urban cameras. Many of these cameras can be found readily. The chapter ends with an example showing how to target and hack into human resources.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter covers Microsoft's IntelliMirror technology that enables change and configuration management for Microsoft Windows XP. IntelliMirror is very tightly integrated with Microsoft's Active Directory service and Group Policies. The features provided by IntelliMirror are the ability to manage users' settings; the ability to manage user's data; and remote software installation and maintenance. Group policy is a core part of Microsoft's IntelliMirror technology. One can use Group Policy to manage all aspects of the client desktop environment for Windows 2000 or Windows XP clients, including registry settings, software installation, scripts, and security settings. Group Policy is implemented in four ways: Local Group Policy; Site Group Policy; Domain Group Policy; and Organizational Unit Group Policy. Using Local Group Policy involves setting up Group Policy on the local machine. This is not very useful for managing computers on a network. Local Group Policy is configured on the local computer. Site Group Policy is when the Group Policy Object (GPO) is linked to the site. Site Group Policies can generate unwanted network traffic, so these should be used only when absolutely necessary. When the Group Policy object is linked to the domain, it is the Domain Group Policy. This will apply the Group Policy Object to all the computers and users within a domain. When the Group Policy object is linked to the organizational unit (OU), it is the Organizational Unit Group Policy. Organizational Unit Group Policy is especially useful for applying a Group Policy object to a logical grouping (organizational unit) of users or computers.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter focuses on the Windows 2000 Server referred as a popular choice for deployment to Internet-facing networks. Despite Microsoft's poor reputation for security in such hostile environments, it is quite possible to secure Windows 2000. Windows 2000's built-in security mechanisms highlight the poor planning that all too often accompanies a new Windows 2000 DMZ server build. The chapter assists the systems engineer to avoid the most common pitfalls in deploying Windows 2000 to a hostile Internet-facing environment using mostly on onboard, built-in tools. Windows 2000 gives some planning, forethought, and creative nondefault configuration steps. Windows 2000 is too risky at the time of building DMZ hosts; too many older, less secure defaults are retained in the name of backward compatibility. Windows 2000 has the feature of “remembering” service pack installed files and so newly installed components install using the most current service pack version by referencing the source files listed. This somewhat under documented feature enhancement of Windows 2000, introduced in Service Pack 1, saves a significant amount of time and eliminates the human error that used to be associated with making minor system state changes to a running Windows server.

AB  - Publisher Summary
A bastion is generally defined as a stronghold or area that is exceptionally fortified against an attack. In network terms this could easily apply to most any security appliance. Typically, however, the term is used to describe a general-purpose networking device that has been intentionally hardened against attack because it will be providing some service to an untrusted network. In most cases, the untrusted network will be the Internet, but it could also be an extranet, wireless DMZ, or business-to-business (B2B) network. The most common examples of a bastion host are an Internet-facing Web server or DNS server. These are servers that, by their nature, are exposed to the Internet and a nearly constant barrage of attacks. These servers can be hardened by applying security patches, configuring logical access controls, and configuring operating system-specific settings to make the system more secure. This chapter provides an overview of the steps that are required to harden a Microsoft Windows 2000 or 2003 server, explaining the relevant concepts, pointing out any pitfalls or caveats in the process, and providing sources of additional information where applicable.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Troubleshooting refers to the process of discovering, diagnosing, and correcting problems. As with any piece of computer software, many potential problems with Internet security and acceleration (ISA) server can be prevented—and time spent troubleshooting thus avoided—by careful deployment planning and attention to details during installation and configuration. Troubleshooting is a specialized form of problem solving. The same general problem-solving skills that work in other areas of life can also be applied to troubleshooting computer problems in general and ISA server-related problems in particular. This chapter discusses systematic set of troubleshooting guidelines that help to organize problem-solving efforts and speed up the diagnostic and treatment process. Five troubleshooting tips endorsed by problem solvers in many fields are precisely defining the problem, recreating the problem, avoiding tunnel vision, practicing the art of patience, using available resources, and not being afraid to ask for help. Finally, the chapter helps to master a new, complex, and exciting software product that promises to be a popular choice for corporate networks all the way up to the enterprise level, where a viable, integrated, easy-to-administer Internet security and acceleration solution is needed.

This chapter explains how to create the actual infrastructure to build, manage, and maintain the site. Depending on the business idea and the logistics involved, the actual implementation may vary slightly from the designs included in the chapter, but the basic concepts remain the same. The chapter explores the process of grouping the systems together in common areas as defined by their requirements for security. These groupings or security zones are regulated by the control systems (such as firewalls and routers) that are deployed in the site. They will also be monitored against attack by intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and other tools deployed within the environment. This chapter discusses some options and considerations for outsourcing the site to a partner at this stage of the project and examines how to select the right partner and the right type of outsourcing solution to meet one's requirements, as well as explore the various types of solutions available.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter covers a wide range of topics related to incident response with emphasis on fundamental principles. Following well-defined and systematic procedures for responding to security related incidents is crucial. By enumerating six stages—preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and postmortem analysis, and follow-up—of essential incident-response activity, a sound set of considerations are provided to use either verbatim or as a basis for developing custom procedures tailored to specific operational environments. The only effective way to respond to incidents is to use a structured methodology. Even if incident-response efforts are conducted systematically, they are of little value if conducted in isolation. Coordinating efforts with others is also a critical facet of incident response. Sharing data about intrusions and malicious code can, for instance, enable others to prevent or recognize and eradicate incidents quickly. Cooperation among an organization's personnel can drastically reduce the manpower needed to respond to incidents and is frequently necessary when a legal investigation is in progress.

The chapter describes Network Monitor, and explores how to use Network Monitor to view network traffic and identify information about the network traffic. Network Monitor is a great tool to help understand and troubleshoot connectivity problems. The chapter discusses the identification and resolution for Internet connectivity problems. It focuses on Network Address Translation (NAT), name resolution, and Internet Protocol (IP) addressing issues. Besides troubleshooting and monitoring regular network traffic, the chapter also focuses on monitoring network traffic that is encrypted. IP Security (IPSec) is based on open standards that are used to provide reliable transmission of encrypted data and authentication of data over IP. Network Monitor captures the frames of data as they are delivered over the wire, time stamps them, and provides the statistical data about those frames. After one has captured the frames of data, Network Monitor may decode the headers and provide an easy-to-read summary of the type of packet, the source, the destination, and if the data is not encrypted, the data in the packet as well.

AB  - This chapter examines an end-to-end architecture solution for a case study. In chapters related to scalability, availability, and performance, we have seen case studies specially targeted for those individual chapters. This chapter extends those concepts, and we will look at a close-to-real-world scenario and architect a solution to satisfy the specified nonfunctional requirements, focusing especially on scalability, availability, performance, and security. We will start with design considerations, integration methods, and major architecture decisions, which lays out the initial platform, and then we will add the scalability, high availability, and high performance features to satisfy the specified requirements. We will see a practical application of the process steps, methodologies, and models that we saw in the first three chapters. At the end, we will look at the final overall logical architecture and the risk and mitigation strategy. This case study is designed to reinforce the concepts learned in earlier chapters and to make the readers aware of the practical application of those concepts through step-by-step examples. Though this is a fictional case study, technical aspects such as integration methods and nonfunctional requirement specification are designed to closely mimic real-world scenarios.

AB  - Publisher Summary
The chapter discusses the combination of risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures associated with social engineering. Most of the vulnerabilities mentioned in the chapter are fairly easy to fix once you know about them. Security will always be a long-term team effort. This is true for every company and every home. If you have a computer in your home and you access the Internet to pay your bills or check your bank statement, you need to consider security every time you do so. Even though we live in a technical world, we can't forget about the physical security at home and work. If you become a victim of identity theft, you will spend about two years getting your financial life back in order. Prevention is your absolute countermeasure for most, if not all, of these possible threats.

AB  - Publisher Summary
In this phase, the attacker looks deeper into the network infrastructure to find actual weaknesses and vulnerabilities to exploit, based on his or her research from the recon and scanning tactics. With user authentication, the danger is always in the hands of the user. While a few users may realize it's prudent to store their passwords in an encrypted database, others may be just as willing to write them on a slip of paper and store them in their wallet. Authentication security attempts can be greatly mitigated by using a strong password policy for one's network and its various login sites. Users should use passwords that are not easily guessable or easily determined through a brute force attack. If an attacker has physical access to a facility, or even a hardware device, they have the potential to completely exploit the resources available. One of the most dangerous attack methods on a network is the ability to simply listen in to other traffic and use it for one's own purposes. Once an attacker has a foothold within the network or infrastructure, a well-placed network sniffer can help provide them with the keys to the kingdom regarding the user's passwords and network usage habits. An attacker can simply place a device within the network to silently collect all information being broadcast across the network, or within a certain network segment. Other exploration techniques include dormant Malware, web browser security, and out-of-band communication.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter focuses on some of the main issues relating to designing perimeter networks. Perimeter networks can be defined as any network that provides services to any other user or network of an unknown security status. These provided services might include Internet access to corporate networks, public access to Internet applications, or possibly even remote access or Virtual Private Networks (VPN) services. The category of perimeter network includes many different types of network functions; however, the one common function found in perimeter networks is a connection point to less trusted networks. In designing perimeter networks, a slightly modified top-down design philosophy is necessary. Because of the prevalence of interconnected networks and Internet applications in today's perimeter network architectures, most designers of perimeter networks put an equal amount of emphasis on designing for security as they do on designing for application requirements.

AB  - Publisher Summary
One of the weaknesses in Windows NT 4.0 is inherent in the default access permissions assigned to the built-in groups for the file system and the Registry. Windows 2000 alleviates that weakness by refining the permissions granted to these groups. It has several built-in groups that are created when the operating system is first installed. Three of these groups contribute significantly to the security of Windows 2000, depending on the default access permissions granted to them. The three groups are Administrators, Power Users, and Users. Permissions vary widely—from Administrators, who have complete control of the entire system all the way down to Users, who have read-only access or no access; Power Users are in the middle of these two extremes. The Power Users group is not a built-in group on domain controllers. Windows 2000 has refined the default file system and Registry permissions given to the Users and Power Users groups to enhance operating system security. Windows 2000 grants default user rights to various groups, depending on which version of the operating system is used. An administrator can change these rights using the Group Policy snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the monitoring tasks. Monitoring is the use of automated processes to collect and analyze the operation of critical Exchange services. Monitoring is an important part of delivering a high-quality messaging service and for achieving commitments of service level agreements (SLAs). The overall goal of monitoring is to avoid possible service outages by predicting problems and by quickly noticing problems that cannot be predicted. This can be accomplished by either continually polling the monitored component or by receiving or detecting events from these components. When the monitoring tool detects a problem, it should automatically alert the Exchange operations staff and should provide immediate information regarding the nature and severity of the problem. The monitoring tools should also be able to react to certain detected problems and initiate automatic recovery procedures. Monitoring is performed for different reasons such as monitoring overall system health, monitoring components to detect and predict trends, monitoring to detect non-delivery of messages, monitoring the backup process, monitoring antivirus software, and monitoring the underlying network.

AB  - Publisher Summary
Windows permissions are discretionary—users with the change permissions or full-control permissions or users who have ownership of a file or folder can change its permissions as much as they want. Windows Server 2003 establishes a default permission structure when the operating system is first installed, but these defaults might need to be changed to meet specific needs. This chapter examines some common risks that can affect file shares, the ways to design a permission structure for the files and folders in a large, multiserver environment, and best practices for securing the Windows Registry. The chapter explores the ways to secure the backup process by physically securing backup media and assigning rights and permissions to perform backups and restores in a secure manner. The recovery process is the last line of defense where security is concerned, and the chapter concludes with a discussion of designing a secure backup and recovery strategy for network resources.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses vulnerability scanning and host evaluations in relation to the INFOSEC Evaluation Methodology. This section of the evaluation requires much more thought than perhaps was initially considered. Modern INFOSEC tools do simplify the task of gathering the suspected vulnerabilities, but the tools do not replace the evaluator's intellect, ability to reason, knowledge, and experience. The evaluator brings his or her skills, technical and nontechnical experience, and appropriate knowledge base to the evaluation efforts. The vulnerability scanning tools provide a tidy list of suspected vulnerabilities, but they are not human and they do not have the ability to reason. The vulnerability scanning tools provides network-based vulnerabilities. Host evaluations are used to gather findings directly from the workstations, servers, network devices, security devices, and the like. One might have different findings based on the perspective to the host/device/component, whether the finding is from an external scan, an internal scan, or a host-based evaluation. These are three different perspectives one can get information from. Once all the findings are gathered, one has to validate them, remove false-positive findings, and map the findings back to the organization's critical INFOSEC systems.

A business continuity and disaster recovery plan provides a step-by-step set of procedures to follow during a disruptive event. The plan enables staff to address the disruption to systems and networks, helps prioritize efforts, and ensures that recovery begins as quickly as possible in a methodical manner. A well-crafted BC/DR plan defines the steps needed to stop the impact of the disaster as well as steps to restart, rebuild, reconfigure, and resume operations. A good plan contains contact information for staff, key vendors, suppliers, experts, and resources.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter addresses the major threats wireless technologies introduce into the workplace and presents strategies to properly reduce and mitigate these threats. Convenience, ease of implementation, and cost are driving factors for the rapid introduction of wireless technologies into the workplace. The introduction and use of any new technologies must be carefully managed and risk must be accurately assessed in order to properly manage the security of any computer system or network. As the radio frequency (RF) waves that carry a signal cannot be physically contained within the bounds of a specific office building or other geographic location, a wireless network essentially extends organization's network as far as the wireless signal can travel. An intruder, who takes advantage of this fact, can be one of the neighbors in the office park, an employee at another organization on a different floor in a building, or a criminal sitting in a parked car in the parking lot. The intruder's intent could be classified in one of two ways: use of network as an Internet hotspot or the abuse of network boundaries to steal data, or use Internet connection to attack others or conduct criminal behavior.

AB  - Client/server-based systems do not easily fit into a cloud computing environment. To be cloud-ready, they must be placed on a Web-accessible centralized server, which typically requires migrating the application language to the cloud. Many issues must be considered when migrating client/server application languages. This chapter discusses technical considerations, including the source language, the organization's skill sets, the need for a Web service-based system, and the target Oracle cloud infrastructure on which the system will run. It also covers business considerations, which entail how quickly a migration ROI must be achieved, the company's business strategy, and new markets it plans to enter. Application cloud migrations can also involve methods such as Web service enablement, rehosting, and virtualization, which are also covered in this chapter. Another major consideration concerns the target architecture; with this in mind, the chapter covers four target hardware and software stack options, and lists their pros and cons.

AB  - So Snort is wonderful and everyone understands how you install and configure it to find all the intrusions and "bad guys" on the network and everyone is happy. But there's still one essential question you must know the answer to: Can you make sure there's no packet loss, and be certain your system is beefy enough to handle every task? If Snort isn't installed on the appropriate machine, it will strongly affect the results and overall usage of the application. Unlike other applications that mainly rely on memory and CPU power, Snort depends on several aspects of the operating system, including network cards, memory, hard disk write speed, hard disk space, and processing power. This chapter explains several system configurations that will attempt to optimize Snort performance for different business requirements on diverse network environments.

AB  - Nowadays, cybersecurity makes headlines across the media and in companies, blogs, social networks, among other places. The Internet is a wild cyberspace, an arena for commercialization, consumerism, business, and leisure, to name a few activities. Networks, populations, and nations around the world, now interconnected through the Internet, rely on it for their daily lives. But some Internet users have learned to take advantage of vulnerable systems and of Internet technologies for their own good, sending out spam, phishing, data breaches, botnets, and other threats. An underground criminal network has emerged, creating complex malware kits for several purposes. “Hacktivism” has become a popular term with many supporters worldwide, but cyberwarfare is now on the rise, gaining more and more attention from nation-states. This chapter provides a quick overview of these topics, discussing them in a timely manner, referencing key events from the past while focusing on the present day.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter deals with system administration, including monitoring and troubleshooting. Event Viewer is basic, simple, and easy to use, which identifies problems by providing documentation and historical reference for the servers. System Information tool is an updated version of the old Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD) that provides read-only information about the server, and also provides documentation. Performance Monitor is the best tool, bundled with Windows NT and 2000 that helps to create performance baseline. Citrix Network Manager is a great tool if HP OpenView or Tivoli NetView manages the servers. Resource Manager builds on the functionality of Microsoft's Performance Monitor by adding components specific to server-based computing. This knowledge requires careful analysis of the environment—operating systems, databases, and applications. Creating and implementing a disaster recovery plan is essential if the business depends on a network, servers, and clients. All the processes are documented in the chapter.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter enlists a number of rules to follow under headings such as monitoring, disclosure, provider protection exception, consent exception, computer trespasser exception, court order exception, best practices, and Canadian best evidence rule. These rules can be confusing, and developing policies around monitoring should always include input from legal counsel, human resources, and other stakeholders. Even though the provider protection exception states that companies can monitor to protect themselves, most organizations also include a clause in corporate policies and employment contracts that reference monitoring, and employees should sign these documents to acknowledge that they have read and understood them. International companies need to consult experts in international law, as monitoring and privacy laws are very different around the world. The chapter states that while most organizations have not prosecuted insiders in the past, prosecution is a growing trend, and that it is important to determine beforehand that the digital evidence being captured is handled in a way that makes it litigation-quality data.

AB  - The various kinds of access decision dependencies within a predicate-based model of database protection are classified according to cost of enforcement. Petri nets and some useful extensions are described. Extended Petri nets are used to model the flow of messages and data during protection enforcement within MULTISAFE, a multimodule system architecture for secure database management. The model demonstrates that some of the stated criteria for security are met within MULTISAFE. Of particular interest is the modeling of data dependent access conditions with predicates at Petri net transitions. Tokens in the net carry the intermodule messages of MULTISAFE. Login, authorization, and database requests are traced through the model as examples. The evaluation of complex access condition predicates is described for the enforcement process. Queues of data and queues of access condition predicates are cycled through the net so that each data record is checked against each predicate. Petri nets are shown to be a useful modeling tool for database security.

AB  - A password authentication mechanism based upon Newton's interpolating polynomial and a strong cryptographic operation such as DES (data encryption standard) is proposed in this paper. The mechanism can respond to any login request very efficiently. It is suitable for real-time applications and can be implemented in microcomputer system. With the properties of Newton's interpolating polynomial, high system performance can be achieved. The basic idea of our method is that users in the system are congregated together. Any illegal modification by an intruder to some user's parameter on the host tables will influence the others and can be easily detected. However, legitimate modification of password could be made efficiently.

This chapter addresses specific problems that commonly occur in conjunction with ISA server. Even though these issues and diagnosis are specific to the ISA server, the methodologies used can help one troubleshoot any firewall. These problems are divided into logical categories. The chapter discusses the common procedure that is most effective in approaching any problem-solving situation, in which one first gathers information, then analyzes the data and come up with possible “diagnoses” or causes, and then implements a solution and assess the success or failure of actions. Finally, this chapter discusses the resources that help solving problems involving ISA server and the windows 2000 Server operating system on which it runs.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the management and the maintenance of internetworks. Management forms an integral part of the design strategy and should be tackled as a proactive task. Maintenance is all too often a reactive task, dealing with unforeseen problems and diagnosing network failures. Network management becomes a key concern as networks grow in both size and complexity. The network manager's activities and responsibilities multiply with the number of devices, services, users, and sites. In a large commercial internetwork, it is important to identify problems and resolve them in a matter of minutes. Network management and control represents a potentially exciting area for investment in the application of artificial intelligence. Management interfaces can be either passive or active. The ISO Management Framework breaks down the network management into the following categories: configuration management, performance management, fault management, security management, and accounting management. However, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is the dominant management framework for enterprise and IP-based internetworks. For medium to large internetworks, network management can impose unacceptable overheads on bandwidth, CPU, and device memory. Ping, traceroute, tcpdump, netstat, and dig are invaluable tools for IP internetwork diagnostics.

AB  - Publisher Summary
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP) is a very powerful—and thus very complex—suite of protocols. Its complexity is necessary in order to achieve the sort of flexibility and scalability needed in the large networks and huge global Internet works that rely on it for everyday communications. This chapter attempts to address some of the more common problems facing the typical administrator of a TCP/IP network based on the new Windows 2000 operating system. The chapter also summarizes the key points of each chapter. The TCP/IP protocol suite has been around—in the context of computer technology— for a long time. The Windows 2000 operating system is new. Together, they work effectively to provide reliable network communications over networks of all sizes. They also present some unique troubleshooting challenges (also known as opportunities) to the network administrator. Learning to live with (and love) them is more a job requirement than an option; it looks as if both will be around for some time to come.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses recent advancements in cryptographic techniques, known as public key cryptography, which provides elegant solutions not only to secrecy and authentication, but also to protection against forgery through a provision called digital signatures. The chapter begins by introducing a few useful concepts, definitions, and notations. The process of transforming the message or plain text and locking its contents from being known to others is called encryption or enciphering. Decryption is the unlocking of the ciphered text to get back the original plain text. The locking and unlocking is done by a key, which is known only to the legitimate sender-receiver and the encryption-decryption pair constitutes a cryptosystem. Cryptography deals with the analysis and design of cryptosystems. The modern public-key cryptosystem uses different keys for the encryption and decryption process. The chapter presents various algorithms for public key cryptosystems and describes its various applications, such as authentication, digital signatures, read-only secure communications, conference key distribution systems, and data-base security.

In his Annual Report to the UK Parliament, the UK's Information Commissioner stated that Freedom of Information and Privacy (Data Protection) are similar, in that both are focused on good practice in handling information and both create important access rights to it. There is enlightened self interest. And data protection is not and should not be just for compliance sake – it should be because it is the right thing to do. Trust is essential to loyalty, prosperity and good government.

AB  - Abstract
Context: In recent years, the valuable knowledge that can be retrieved from petabyte scale datasets – known as Big Data – led to the development of solutions to process information based on parallel and distributed computing. Lately, Apache Hadoop has attracted strong attention due to its applicability to Big Data processing. Problem: The support of Hadoop by the research community has provided the development of new features to the framework. Recently, the number of publications in journals and conferences about Hadoop has increased consistently, which makes it difficult for researchers to comprehend the full body of research and areas that require further investigation. Solution: We conducted a systematic literature review to assess research contributions to Apache Hadoop. Our objective was to identify gaps, providing motivation for new research, and outline collaborations to Apache Hadoop and its ecosystem, classifying and quantifying the main topics addressed in the literature. Results: Our analysis led to some relevant conclusions: many interesting solutions developed in the studies were never incorporated into the framework; most publications lack sufficient formal documentation of the experiments conducted by authors, hindering their reproducibility; finally, the systematic review presented in this paper demonstrates that Hadoop has evolved into a solid platform to process large datasets, but we were able to spot promising areas and suggest topics for future research within the framework.

AB  - Chapter 3 shows an example how to define the business needs and find an effective solution based on the second chapter’s process. It is one of study cases for cost rationalization by leveraging cloud solution. In order to define the right cloud solution for IT cost rationalization, we have to first clarify all stack lays of the cloud infrastructure. It intends to lay the foundation of cloud cost infrastructure based on the idea of IT infrastructure Opex rationalization.

AB  - In the first part of this article we defined a vulnerability and discussed how to determine the importance of vulnerabilities. We looked at many types of vulnerabilities. Most people think of a vulnerability as something that gets exploited by ‘hacking in’ to organizations and systems by strangers on the outside. We looked at several important vulnerabilities not usually given much consideration because of that preconception: legal vulnerabilities, personnel/human resources vulnerabilities, premises vulnerabilities, phone switch vulnerabilities, disaster recovery/contingency planning vulnerabilities, insurance vulnerabilities, policy vulnerabilities, password vulnerabilities, default value vulnerabilities and improper access control vulnerabilities. It was shown that it was neither possible nor effective to remove all vulnerabilities, but that proper analyses were necessary to determine which to treat.

AB  - Abstract
Machine learning algorithms are widely used for traffic classification and anomaly detection nowadays, however, how to fast and accurately classify the flows remains extremely challengeable. In this paper, we propose an extreme learning machine (ELM) based algorithm called L1-Norm Minimization ELM, which fully inherits the merits of ELM, and meanwhile, exhibits the sparsity-induced characteristics which could reduce the complexity of learning model. At the evaluation stage, we preprocessed the raw data trace from trans-Pacific backbone link between Japan and the United States, and generated 248 features datasets. The empirical study shows that L1-ELM can achieve good generalization performance on the evaluation datasets, while preserving the fast learning and little human intervened advantages that ELM has.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter examines the concepts storage systems—sites that can be used if the primary site is destroyed or rendered useless—as well as the way to implement layers of protection to help one to keep the systems up to achieve whatever the desired uptime is. DRPs are also briefly described in the chapter. A disaster recovery plan is a set of documents used to identify potential threats and outline the procedures that are necessary to deal with different types of threats, disasters, and anything else not of the norm and clearly defined with action in the plan. When creating a disaster recovery plan, administrators should try to identify all the different types of threats that may affect the company. Once the administrator has determined what disasters their company could face, they can then create procedures to minimize the risk of such disasters. The chapter also discusses the importance of documenting the network. In an emergency, having an up-to-date and accurate set of documentation is very important.

AB  - Publisher Summary
There are many facets to the planning of Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) 2005 architecture, and the complexity of design that is based on the needs of the organization and their monitoring goals. The chapter discusses different components that can make up MOM 2005 architecture, and focuses on a number of different areas involved in the planning of MOM topology, including capacity, redundancy, and configuration planning. It also focuses on the MOM 2005 Solution Accelerators, and provides a brief overview of what each of these can offer you and where to find them when faced with more advanced configurations. Planning MOM 2005 infrastructure is not difficult but does require that you perform due diligence and collect the information required to make decisions. As you start your collection, analysis, and planning, keep the four main planning areas—features, capacity, redundancy, and configuration—in mind. Take advantage of the tools and documentation available to you in the form of the capacity planning worksheets, performance and sizing whitepaper, and the new System Center Capacity Planner utility. Remember that planning is time well spent.

AB  - This chapter outlines how to create and maintain low privileged users in order to serve as the user context for different services and applications.
Publisher Summary
This chapter outlines the many ways one can limit the authority of a service user account. It defines how to configure such an account to perform its required function with minimal privileges. It discusses how to manage and administer this account in AD with group policy, and a new method of measuring password strength in a way that gives tangible results is explained. This chapter also identifies creating and configuring service user accounts and preparing application (SQL). SQL is an extremely complex application suite, so specific details will change based on what SQL must do, but, in general, the user account is altered to have the following rights in general: logon as a service, adjusting memory quotas for a process, bypass traverse checking, replacing a process-level token, and having the appropriate file-level access permissions.

AB  - The conversion of legacy single-user applications into collaborative multi-user tools is a recurrent topic in groupware scenarios. Many recent literature works have tried to achieve transparent collaboration, which consists of enabling collaborative features without modifying the original application source code.

In this paper, we define the available whitebox and blackbox models of transparent collaboration. Each of them differs on which degree the developer must have of the target application inner knowledge, in order to convert it into a multi-user tool. Moreover, we propose and define a novel blackbox model and its implementation (TaKo). Our proposal achieves complete transparency by intercepting user interface libraries and input events. This is the first blackbox solution constructed on top of interception technologies (Aspect Oriented Programming) and, unlike previous approaches, it provides support to both AWT and Swing applications. Our solution solves five important problems: simultaneous work, management of replicated resources (random number generators), collaborative services binding, detailed group awareness information, late joining, and unanticipated sharing support. We are also researching a prospective work on wide-area collaboration scenarios by using a peer-to-peer event substrate. Finally, this work provides validation of TaKo with several Swing-based and AWT-based tools, demonstrating that it is generic and imposes very low overhead.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the concept and practical application of risk management. It looks at the broad business perspective, the practical business continuity and disaster recovery planning perspective, and the IT-centric perspective. It looks at risk management to provide the understanding of the overall process, and then delve into the risk assessment process. Business continuity and disaster recovery planning begins with a thorough risk assessment. Risk assessment is part of a larger risk management process found in most businesses. The four major components of the business continuity (BC)/disaster recovery (DR) risk assessment are threat assessment, vulnerability assessment, impact assessment, and risk mitigation strategy development. In order to perform a thorough threat assessment, one needs to look at threats and threat sources both internal and external to the company. It is often helpful to assess risk based on the potential risks to people, process, technology, and infrastructure. The methods used to gather data for any of the assessment phases typically include questionnaires, interviews, document reviews, and research. Questionnaires can be helpful in structuring desired input but also can have the downside of containing built-in biases, often unintentionally. Interviews can be conducted with subject matter experts and yield more useful information than questionnaires but may also generate a lot of tangential or unneeded data. Reviewing documents and performing research can supplement the questionnaire and interview process. Risk assessment activities will end up generating a list of threats and threat sources that one will be able to evaluate.

AB  - National and international telecommunication infrastructures have been set up through Europe to facilitate the movement of information. One major benefactor of the improved communication infrastructures is the health care community. The accessibility and interoperability of medical information systems is one of the grand challenges for the 21st century. Within Europe current developments in the application of telemedicine are being defined in separate initiatives. There are a number of pilot actions concentrating on various aspects of telemedicine. These actions involving the introduction of new technology or working practices rarely fail for technology related problems. However, in order to fully assess the likely take-up of telemedical technologies it is vital that all the aspects including non-technical are also addressed.

This paper describes how a complete pilot telemedical information society will be set up which facilitates to support secure and standardised remote diagnosis, teleconsultations and advanced medical facilities in a number of sectors covering a crucial spectrum of those required to support a complete telemedical information society. This pilot testbed will then be assessed in the context of a European environment identifying a business plan for its extension to other member states therefore promoting a truly international telemedical information society for the 21st century.

AB  - Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the major components of neurocore database and their relation to the design criteria. A neurocore database consists of four main components—namely, core database, database extension interface, database federation interface, and new data types for the database created as data blades. The core framework cannot store a complete neuroscientific experiment because it lacks the extensions that allow to the full description of the experimental preparation and the types of research data that are being collected. The core schema of neurocore consists of five basic components: core experimental framework, neuroanatomical concepts, neurochemical concepts, database federation interface, and database extension interface. The core experimental framework in neurocore contains the database tables that store the information needed for storing an experiment. The neuroanatomical section of the neurocore database contains the basic neuroanatomical information needed to provide the framework for storing specific neuroanatomical data, as well as for providing the proper anatomical framework to store any neuroscience experiment within the neurocore. The federation interface enables each neurocore database to share information with other databases.

AB  - Abstract
Creating a business continuity plan unique to your operation is critical for your success. Each organization will handle potential threats and associated risks differently. Each company will have to take into account location, industry, organizational culture, company structure, departments, work units, management approach, and strategic objectives. Each of these elements impacts how your organization responds to threats. For that reason, a very important step in this process is performing the risk assessment.

AB  - Abstract
Program understanding involves mapping domain concepts to the code elements that implement them. Such mapping is often implicit and undocumented. However, identifier names contain relevant clues to rediscover the mapping and make it available to programmers.

In this paper, we present two approaches that exploit structural and linguistic aspects of the source code to extract ontologies. The extracted ontologies are then compared in terms of the concepts they contain and the support they give to program understanding, specifically concept location. Such ontologies are composed of domain and implementation concepts as they come from the source code. To filter domain concepts, we have applied Information Retrieval (IR) based filtering techniques. We have assessed the resulting ontologies against a reference, manually defined, domain ontology.

The experimentation was carried out using six real world open source programs. Results show that the ontologies extracted using the structural and linguistic aspects of the source code are complementary. We also observed that their union gives a better support to concept location than the individual ontologies. Filtering the ontologies gives a concise representation of the domain knowledge captured in the source code. The filtered ontologies, however, have been found to be less effective in supporting concept location than the unfiltered ontologies.
