Abstract = {{Webservice is a software technology as the representative method of
   information communication currently used to create a dynamic system
   environment that is configured to fulfill its users' needs. Therefore,
   analyzing log data that occurred at provision is being used as the
   significant basic data in webservice research. Thanks to development of
   Cloud computing technology, it has resulted in centralized points from
   which data is generated and data enlargement. A research is now
   implemented to create information from collecting, processing and
   converting flood of data and to obtain the new various items of
   information. Against this backdrop, it is justified that collection,
   storage and analysis of web log data in the existing conventional RDBMS
   system may be inadequate to process the enlarged log data. This research
   propose a framework which to integrate web log for storage using HBase,
   a repository of the Cloud computing-based NoSQL. In addition, data
   validation must be completed in the pre-process when collecting web log.
   The validated log is stored in the modeling structure in which takes
   features of web log into account. According to the results, introduction
   of NoSQL system is found to integrate the enlargement of log data in
   more efficient manner. By comparisons with the existing RDBMS in terms
   of data processing performance, it was proved that the NoSQL- based
   database had a superior performance.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenal increase in the amounts of network security data are due
   to the hacker attacks, virus, worm and Shipper etc. Network security log
   file databases are very important in computer forensics. A lot of data
   mining methods to research it have been found, such as content-based
   queries and similarity searches to manage and use such data. Fast and
   accurate retrievals for content-based queries are crucial for such
   numerous database systems to be useful. In this paper, a new method is
   provided to analyze and mine this kind of time-serial database. We first
   signalize the NSD databases, then we use these wavelet based transforms
   to analyze the NSD and get the periodic law of intrusion event.}},
