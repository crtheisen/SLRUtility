AB  - Today's computer networks produce a huge amount of security log data. Handling this data is impossible without using Security Information and Event Management Systems (SIEM) to centralize the log management and increase the level of information security and data protection in the organization. SIEM collect and aggregate log data from various devices and applications through software called agents or connectors, filter uninteresting data and normalize to a proprietary format, analyses through correlation using contextual information and alert administrators in case of attack. SIEM provide proactive threat detection and real-time analysis of system activity. Handling these issues will be very hard without relying on consolidated, big data-powered SIEM. However, even having the most expensive SIEM solution, the organization should not expect the product to work great out of the box. The best SIEM solution does not guarantee success. The organization should focus on building various use cases to make their SIEM solution a success. In this paper, we propose a new model and architecture for SIEM implementation that is using multiple hierarchical SIEM Managers. The model is called &#x201C;Hierarchical Managers Model&#x201D;. We demonstrated how this model and architecture could be created and enabled in the leading SIEM system - ArcSight ESM [7]. We also provide examples of possible use cases that we have created and tested in our testing environment. These are meant to provide a good base starting point and should not be considered comprehensive for all situations. The use cases shown in this paper are created using the security event correlation framework from Hewlett-Packard - ArcSight ESM [7].

AB  - Security log analysis is extremely useful for uncovering intrusions and anomalies. However, the sheer volume of log data demands new frameworks and techniques of computing and security. We present a lightweight distributed and parallel security log analysis framework that allows organizations to analyze a massive number of system, network, and transaction logs efficiently and scalably. Different from the general distributed frameworks, e.g., MapReduce, our framework is specifically designed for security log analysis. It features a minimum set of necessary properties, such as dynamic task scheduling for streaming logs. For prototyping, we implement our framework in Amazon cloud environments (EC2 and S3) with a basic analysis application. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our design and shows the potential of our cloud-based distributed framework in large-scale log analysis scenarios.

AB  - During recent years, establishing proper metrics for measuring system security has received increasing attention. Security logs contain vast amounts of information which are essential for creating many security metrics. Unfortunately, security logs are known to be very large, making their analysis a difficult task. Furthermore, recent security metrics research has focused on generic concepts, and the issue of collecting security metrics with log analysis methods has not been well studied. In this paper, we will first focus on using log analysis techniques for collecting technical security metrics from security logs of common types (e.g., Network IDS alarm logs, workstation logs, and Net flow data sets). We will also describe a production framework for collecting and reporting technical security metrics which is based on novel open-source technologies for big data.

AB  - The messages generated by the security devices represent the necessary data for the detection of the malicious activities in an information system. The heterogeneity of the devices and the lack of a standard for the security messages make the automatic processing of the messages difficult. The messages are short, use a very wide vocabulary and have different formats. We propose in this article the collaboration between classifiers to increase the accuracy of the classification. We apply the text categorization technics for the automatic classification of security log files messages, in categories defined by an ontology. We develop an extraction module for the message attributes to reduce the vocabulary size. Then we apply two training algorithms: the k-nearest neighbour algorithm and the naive Bayes, on two corpus of security log messages. Finally we propose to collaborate the classifiers to produce a single classifier with better accuracy.

AB  - With the widespread use of information, variety of security logs have increased greatly, which due need for security log management. Organizations requirements have imposed to collect, store, and analyze tremendous volumes of log data across entire infrastructure for extended durations and at increasingly granular levels. It is the process of generating, transmitting, storing, analyzing, and disposing security log data from network to databases. Due to the wide variety of logs, storing comprises different methods. Recorded events in collection module are processed, normalized and classified. Logs are stored in storage module in order to use in forensic, reviewing, auditing and providing further necessities of correlation module. Routine log correlation analysis is beneficial for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activities, troubleshooting and operational network problems. So log management is an important and efficient activity in network monitoring. Finding an effective log management functional architecture for network events analysis is the main goal of this paper. In this paper, we aim to suggest log management architecture with more common functions that are used by vendors. By studying logging architectures the main functions are administration of log collection, normalizing, categorization, queuing prioritizing and storing logged events/alarms by sensors. Log functions are different but the suitable architecture must justify the functions to send a normative, synchronized and prioritized log in an efficient way. The mentioned functions are gathered from SIEM products characteristics. Suggested architecture includes functions and activities in log collection server and storage server.

In open and distributed environment TN brings convenience in resource share, while it still has some shortcomings, such as easy to fail in negotiation, difficult to track userspsila deed and so on.... Security log provides a method to analyze the past and present status of TN for system administrator. According the current state of TN, a security log based trust negotiation model is proposed in the paper by combining security log with TN, which helps efficiently find out why the negotiation fails and track userspsila deed by recording all kinds of negotiation states.

AB  - Describes typical operations channels for a circuit switch and the generic requirements that should be met to secure these channels. The author discusses the technical analysis of these features, and the major results obtained from analyses of circuit switches produced by various vendors. The general technological trend in switch design has been to incorporate a flexible architecture that allows assigning any operations function to any input port; the assignments are software-driven. The newer switches, in general, all provide this flexibility. All switches have login features that can be deployed on a majority of operations channels. Different switches have different levels of protection against password cracking. Time-out is a common feature among switches and resource control is available on a limited basis. Except for a few conspicuous exceptions, switches generally provide a security log and associated audit features

AB  - The network log file database is important to security management. But, with the development of Internet, it has become too bulkiness to be used directly. In this paper, the wavelet decomposition is adopted to mining the useful rules from the network security data. This is different from traditional data mining methods of association rules. Multi-resolution analysis of wavelet transform method is used to analyze and mine the data of network security log file database on different time scale. The period law of the attack number in different time domain is found by this method. These are important messages for taking relevant measures to insure network security.

However, the problem is that these systems often require proprietary hardware and do not involve web usage mining to analyze the log data. The purpose of this paper is to investigate an approach towards a framework for managing security logs in enterprise organizations called of the anomaly detection system (ADS), built to detect anomalous behavior inside computer networks that is free from hardware constraints and benefits from web usage mining to extract useful information from the log files.
