Abstract = {{Objective: To report the results of a systematic literature review
   concerning the security and privacy of electronic health record (EHR)
   systems.
   Data sources: Original articles written in English found in MEDLINE, ACM
   Digital Library, Wiley Inter-Science, IEEE Digital Library,
   Science@Direct, MetaPress, ERIC, CINAHL and Trip Database.
   Study selection: Only those articles dealing with the security and
   privacy of EHR systems.
   Data extraction: The extraction of 775 articles using a predefined
   search string, the outcome of which was reviewed by three authors and
   checked by a fourth.
   Results: A total of 49 articles were selected, of which 26 used
   standards or regulations related to the privacy and security of EHR
   data. The most widely used regulations are the Health Insurance
   Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European Data
   Protection Directive 95/46/EC. We found 23 articles that used symmetric
   key and/or asymmetric key schemes and 13 articles that employed the
   pseudo anonymity technique in EHR systems. A total of 11 articles
   propose the use of a digital signature scheme based on PKI (Public Key
   Infrastructure) and 13 articles propose a login/password (seven of them
   combined with a digital certificate or PIN) for authentication. The
   preferred access control model appears to be Role-Based Access Control
   (RBAC), since it is used in 27 studies. Ten of these studies discuss who
   should define the EHR systems' roles. Eleven studies discuss who should
   provide access to EHR data: patients or health entities. Sixteen of the
   articles reviewed indicate that it is necessary to override defined
   access policies in the case of an emergency. In 25 articles an audit-log
   of the system is produced. Only four studies mention that system users
   and/or health staff should be trained in security and privacy.
   Conclusions: Recent years have witnessed the design of standards and the
   promulgation of directives concerning security and privacy in EHR
   systems. However, more work should be done to adopt these regulations
   and to deploy secure EHR systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify
   suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to
   form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability
   to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past
   two decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed
   information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to
   improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that
   transparently monitors and records data access events within a
   virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the
   hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and
   follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after
   the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these
   transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for
   faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the
   changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we
   provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case
   study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable
   information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been
   detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking
   mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple
   disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.}},

Abstract = {{Accountability is a very important topic for computer and networking
   systems. It helps to answer questions such as, What happened? and, Who
   did it? These two questions are also related to forensics; however,
   forensics normally tries to answer these questions by adding some human
   factors (such as a guess or an instinct due to missing evidence, as well
   as human involvements) under the available system. Accountability, on
   the other hand, can only be achieved by significantly improving the
   current system with the result that forensics becomes trivial in an
   accountable system. Furthermore, each entity in the system must be held
   responsible for its activities. In order to provide accountability, a
   better logging system is necessary so that not only their activities but
   also their relationships may be captured. To this end, our previous work
   proposed a novel logging mechanism, flow-net methodology, for
   accountability. In this paper, we extend the flow-net methodology and
   present its design and implementation in wireless networks. We also
   evaluate the performance of flow-net and compare it with that of audit
   log files. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Accountability implies that any entity should be held responsible for
   its own specific action or behavior so that the entity is part of larger
   chains of accountability. One of the goals of accountability is that
   once an event has transpired, the events that took place are traceable
   so that the causes can be determined afterward. The poor accountability
   provided by today's computers and networks wastes a great deal of money
   and effort; examples include activities to identify whether a system is
   under reconnaissance or attack, and the difficulties of distinguishing
   legitimate emails from phishing attacks. This is due to the simple fact
   that today's computing and network infrastructure was not built with
   accountability in mind. In this article we propose a novel methodology
   called flow-net for accountability. We apply this methodology to media
   access control and routing layers in wireless networks. We then compare
   the performance of flow-net with audit log files. This article presents
   a novel approach for traffic data collection that can also be used for
   forensics and intrusion detection purposes.}},

   different devices, not necessarily clock synchronized, and they do not
   arrive in the same order they are generated. Nevertheless, log
   information has to be coherent in time to be useful. To support the
   events we propose to use Lamport's logic clocks, originated at different
