AB  - Securely maintaining log records over extended periods of time is very important to the proper functioning of any organization. Integrity of the log files and that of the logging process need to be ensured at all times. In addition, as log files often contain sensitive information, confidentiality and privacy of log records are equally important. However, deploying a secure logging infrastructure involves substantial capital expenses that many organizations may find overwhelming. Delegating log management to the cloud appears to be a viable cost saving measure. In this paper, we identify the challenges for a secure cloud-based log management service and propose a framework for doing the same.

AB  - Today, the ability to investigate internal matters such as policy violations, regulatory compliance, and employee separation has become important in order for corporations to manage risk. The degree of information security threats evolving on a daily basis has increasingly raised concerns for enterprise organizations. These threats include but are not limited to fraud, insider threat and intellectual property (IP) theft. These have increased the demand for organizations to implement corporate forensics as a deterrent to illegitimate acts or for linking perpetrators to their illegitimate acts. This explains why forensic practices are expanding from the traditional role in law enforcement and becoming an essential part of business processes. However, most organizations may not be maximizing the benefits of corporate forensic capabilities because of lack of corporate forensic governance best practices, needed to ensure organizations prepare their operating environment for digital forensic investigation. Corporate forensic governance will help ensure that digital evidence is obtained in an efficient and effective way with minimal interruption to the business. This paper presents a corporate forensic governance framework intended to enhance forensic readiness, governance, and management, and increase the use of automated forensic techniques and in-house forensically sound practices in large organizations that have a need for these practices.

AB  - Establishing contractual liabilities in case of litigation is generally a delicate matter. It becomes even more challenging when IT systems are involved. At the core of the problem lies the issue of the evidence provided by the opposing parties. We believe that the means to constitute evidence that could be used in case of conflict should be considered from the onset of IT projects and be part of the requirements for the design of IT systems. This paper proposes criteria for acceptable log architectures depending on the features of the system and the potential claims between the parties. We establish properties guaranteed by acceptable architectures and illustrate our framework with a travel booking system.

AB  - With the widespread use of information, variety of security logs have increased greatly, which due need for security log management. Organizations requirements have imposed to collect, store, and analyze tremendous volumes of log data across entire infrastructure for extended durations and at increasingly granular levels. It is the process of generating, transmitting, storing, analyzing, and disposing security log data from network to databases. Due to the wide variety of logs, storing comprises different methods. Recorded events in collection module are processed, normalized and classified. Logs are stored in storage module in order to use in forensic, reviewing, auditing and providing further necessities of correlation module. Routine log correlation analysis is beneficial for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activities, troubleshooting and operational network problems. So log management is an important and efficient activity in network monitoring. Finding an effective log management functional architecture for network events analysis is the main goal of this paper. In this paper, we aim to suggest log management architecture with more common functions that are used by vendors. By studying logging architectures the main functions are administration of log collection, normalizing, categorization, queuing prioritizing and storing logged events/alarms by sensors. Log functions are different but the suitable architecture must justify the functions to send a normative, synchronized and prioritized log in an efficient way. The mentioned functions are gathered from SIEM products characteristics. Suggested architecture includes functions and activities in log collection server and storage server.

AB  - Forensic analysis of software log files is used to extract user behavior profiles, detect fraud, and check compliance with policies and regulations. Software systems maintain several types of log files for different purposes. For example, a system may maintain logs for debugging, monitoring application performance, and/or tracking user access to system resources. The objective of my research is to develop and validate a minimum set of log file attributes and software security metrics for user nonrepudiation by measuring the degree to which a given audit log file captures the data necessary to allow for meaningful forensic analysis of user behavior within the software system. For a log to enable user nonrepudiation, the log file must record certain data fields, such as a unique user identifier. The log must also record relevant user activity, such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting system resources, as well as software security events, such as the addition or revocation of user privileges. Using a grounded theory method, I propose a methodology for observing the current state of activity logging mechanisms in healthcare, education, and finance, then I quantify differences between activity logs and logs not specifically intended to capture user activity. I will then propose software security metrics for quantifying the forensic-ability of log files. I will evaluate my work with empirical analysis by comparing the performance of my metrics on several types of log files, including both activity logs and logs not directly intended to record user activity. My research will help software developers strengthen user activity logs for facilitating forensic analysis for user nonrepudiation.

AB  - Trustable log data is essential in digital forensic investigations in order to allow reliable reconstruction of events. Existing solutions do not provide adequate protection, exposing the log-producing application to software-based attacks. In this paper we provide a solution based on Trusted Computing using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and AMD's Secure Virtual Machine technology (SVM). While current solutions only protect against manipulation of existing logs, we go one step further by establishing hardware-based trust in the log producing application. Our solution ensures confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation during creation, storage and transmission of log data.

AB  - Auditing is a key part of the security infrastructure in a database system. While commercial database systems provide mechanisms such as triggers that can be used to track and log any changes made to &#x201C;sensitive&#x201D; data using UPDATE queries, they are not useful for tracking accesses to sensitive data using complex SQL queries, which is important for many applications given recent laws such as HIPAA. In this paper, we propose the notion of SELECT triggers that extends triggers to work for SELECT queries in order to facilitate data auditing. We discuss the challenges in integrating SELECT triggers in a database system including specification, semantics as well as efficient implementation techniques. We have prototyped our framework in a commercial database system and present an experimental evaluation of our framework using the TPC-H benchmark.

AB  - Audit logs, providing information about the current and past states of systems, are one of the most important parts of modern computer systems. Providing security for audit logs on an untrusted machine in a large distributed system is a challenging task, especially in the presence of active adversaries. In such a system, it is critical to have forward security such that when an adversary compromises a machine, she cannot modify or forge the log entries accumulated before the compromise. Unfortunately, existing secure audit logging schemes have significant limitations that make them impractical for real-life applications: existing public key cryptography (PKC) based schemes are computationally expensive for logging in task intensive or resource-constrained systems, while existing symmetric schemes are not publicly verifiable and incur significant storage and communication overheads. In this paper, we propose a novel forward secure and aggregate logging scheme called blind-aggregate-forward (BAF) logging scheme, which is suitable for large distributed systems. BAF can produce publicly verifiable forward secure and aggregate signatures with near-zero computational, storage, and communication costs for the loggers, without requiring any online trusted third party (TTP) support. We prove that BAF is secure under appropriate computational assumptions, and demonstrate that BAF is significantly more efficient and scalable than the previous schemes. Therefore, BAF is an ideal solution for secure logging in both task intensive and resource-constrained systems.

AB  - DoD represents an environment of continuously changing mission requirements that requires our Information Systems to adapt to accomplish new tasks, quicker, in a more efficient manner. Agility is the only way we will be able to keep up with this change. But there are subtleties that must be considered as we adopt various agile methods: secure, protect, control and authenticate are all elements needed to posture our Information Technology systems to counteract the real and perceived threats in today's environment. Many systems have been tasked to ingest process and analyze different data sets than they were originally designed for and they have to interact with multiple new systems that were unaccounted for at design time. Leveraging the tenets of security, we have devised a new framework that takes agility into a new realm where the product will built to work in a service-based environment but is developed using agile processes. Even though these two criteria promise to hone the development effort, they actually contradict each other in philosophy where Services require stable interfaces, while Agile focuses on being flexible and tolerate changes up to much later stages of development. This framework is focused on enabling a successful product development that capitalizes on both philosophies.

AB  - Growth of network technology and easy internet access are the key features for development and use of Database-as-a-Service (DaaS) technique. In DaaS technique it is necessary to ensure safe and correct operation of any industry. In many cases, the types of data records used to conduct security audits are considered sensitive, as they could reveal information about internal network structures, the types of software running, private customer or employee information. In this paper we suggest a technique based on system of linear equations, which enables a trusted party to give the service provider's server the ability to test whether a given keyword appears in log records but the server learns nothing about the keyword and the log content. We compare our scheme with existing encryption schemes and prove that our scheme is efficient and secure.

AB  - Most of the early Virtual Private Networks (VPN) connection came from the vendors of networking hardware and software to satisfy one time goal of security in communication in a remote way. The first and foremost of the solution of VPN is to introduce the security protocols like IPSec. IPSec uses cryptography in order to encrypt and authenticate the traffic flowing between point of interest. This is a large set of related protocols operating above the IP layer of the OSI stack, each represented by an RFC specification. It is required that each vendor implements these specifications exactly, in order to be able to interoperate with other vendors. The IPsec access configuration is suffered from non-standardization as the vendors have the liberty of implementing the access requirements that are not restrictive by a specific standard. This paper presents a survey of various VPN categories and some specific products. It outlines the compliance requirement as per various domain specific security policy. The paper shows a successful mechanism to incorporate the compliance requirement into the body of security protocols or firewalls of VPN enhancing the VPN security further as per standard. Such enhanced VPN security satisfies legal bindings as it satisfies the compliance rules/laws of a country. The paper also summarizes the interoperability issues that appear when configuring IPsec on different vendor devices and draws a few conclusions on the level of protocol compliance deciding which VPN solution a customer needs for his/her business.

AB  - Accountability implies that any entity should be held responsible for its own specific action or behavior so that the entity is part of larger chains of accountability. One of the goals of accountability is that once an event has transpired, the events that took place are traceable so that the causes can be determined afterward. The poor accountability provided by today's computers and networks wastes a great deal of money and effort; examples include activities to identify whether a system is under reconnaissance or attack, and the difficulties of distinguishing legitimate emails from phishing attacks. This is due to the simple fact that today's computing and network infrastructure was not built with accountability in mind. In this article we propose a novel methodology called flow-net for accountability. We apply this methodology to media access control and routing layers in wireless networks. We then compare the performance of flow-net with audit log files. This article presents a novel approach for traffic data collection that can also be used for forensics and intrusion detection purposes.

To this end, our previous work proposed a novel logging mechanism, flow-net methodology, for accountability. In this paper, we extend the flow-net methodology and present its design and implementation in wireless networks. We also evaluate the performance of flow-net and compare it to that of audit log files.

AB  - Information restriction controls access and renders records immutable, information accountability requires data transparency to easily and efficiently determine when a particular use is appropriate. Information accountability in the context of relational databases is associated with time in a surprising number of ways, as is summarized in this paper. Notarization and validation of a database exploit the temporal semantics of a transaction-time database. A corruption can be associated with multiple times. Forensic analysis determines the when: bounds on the corruption time, and the where: also specified in terms of time. These bounds are depicted in a two-dimensional corruption diagram, with both axes denoting time. The various kinds of corruption events are defined in terms of time. A parameter termed the regret interval has significant security and performance implications. This paper emphasizes the deep connections between time and the definition, detection, forensic analysis, and characterized extent of a database corruption within the context of information accountability.

AB  - Forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past two decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.

This paper gives a detailed overview of what would be required to (1) link log data for multiple services supported by non-local servers and (2) trace cloud-based services, focusing on prevailing web-based cloud services. The paper presents a robust accountability framework and discusses how cryptography could be applied to log data accountability.

AB  - Existing solutions for data protection and privacy in data outsourcing scenario generally emphasize on the access control model integrated with the advanced cryptographic techniques. However, the complexity of key management is still a recurrent problem when the environment composes of enormous numbers of users and several resource owners. In addition, the administrative capabilities to control the policies enforced in the collaborative cloud environment where several owners and users have not been explicitly provided by the existing works. In this paper, we propose a privacy enhancing access control model to address the scalability and fine-grained access control for outsourced data in multi-owner setting. The focus is to serve the privacy and integrity of outsourced data as well as the accountability. To this end, we employ a PKI key management and access control scheme to serve the security and privacy for the data, policy, and communication. We employ multi-agent system to accommodate multi-policy enforcement and support parallel processing of authorization requests. Our model supports both read and write access control and integrity of all access operations is served by signature-based that enables a full accountability of all accesses.

Our proposal is based on two ontologies, L2TAP and SCIP, designed for deployment in a Linked Data environment. L2TAP provides provenance enabled logging of events. SCIP synthesizes contextual integrity concepts and enables query based solutions for two important privacy processes (compliance and obligation derivation). We include an experimental validation of the scalability of our approach.

AB  - According to the trusted systems evaluation criteria (TCSEC) paradigm, if untrusted subjects are constrained by the trusted computer base (TCB), they may safely execute software of unknown assurance while accessing sensitive information. Untrusted subjects, however, can leak sensitive information, undermine the TCB's accountability mechanisms, and destroy information integrity. Hence, the security properties needed by many organizations cannot be enforced at the TCSEC security perimeter, i.e., the TCB interface. We propose an alternative approach that redraws the security perimeter of a trusted system so that it encompasses not only a TCSEC TCB but the Controlled Application Set (CAS), a collection of software components for which some assurance of benign behavior has been obtained. Non-CAS components may also be present on a system bird may be used to manipulate only non-sensitive information. The approach advocates a form of balanced assurance in which the assurance sought for CAS components is commensurate with residual security risks they present. We propose practical assurance requirements, including new functional requirements for TCBs. Examples illustrate the applicability of the approach to confidentiality, accountability, and integrity

AB  - Secure logs are powerful tools for building systems that must resist forgery, prove temporal relationships, and stand up to forensic scrutiny. The proofs of order and integrity encoded in these tamper-evident chronological records, typically built using hash chaining, may be used by applications to enforce operating constraints or sound alarms at suspicious activity. However, existing research stops short of discussing how one might go about automatically determining whether a given secure log satisfies a given set of constraints on its records. In this paper, we discuss our work on Querifier, a tool that accomplishes this. It can be used offline as an analyzer for static logs, or online during the runtime of a logging application. Querifier rules are written in a flexible pattern-matching language that adapts to arbitrary log structures; given a set of rules and available log data, Querifier presents evidence of correctness and offers counterexamples if desired. We describe Querfier's implementation and offer early performance results.

With EMR, health services can be provided at accelerated rate but privacy, security and storage of information will be of concern. There are different regulations for the use and disclosure of health information. In this research study, we focus on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and discuss how it protects health information of an individual while allowing the flow of information to carry out necessary health care functions. The web based EMR system is proposed based on security and privacy features defined by HIPAA.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel secure auditing scheme for cloud computing systems. Several auditing schemes have been proposed for the cloud, which periodically trigger the auditing function. These schemes are designed to monitor the performance and behavior of the cloud. One major problem with these kind of schemes is that they are vulnerable to the transient attack (also known as the timed scrubbing attack). Our secure auditing scheme is able to prevent the transient attack via modification of the Linux auditing daemon - auditd, which creates attestable logs. Our scheme utilizes the System Management Mode (SMM) for integrity checks and the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip for attestable security. Specifically, we modify the auditing daemon protocol such that it records a hash of each audit log entry to the TPM's Platform Configuration Register (PCR), which gives us an attestable history of every command executed on the cloud server. We perform real experiments on two cloud servers and the results show that the overhead of our scheme is very small.

The general technological trend in switch design has been to incorporate a flexible architecture that allows assigning any operations function to any input port; the assignments are software-driven. The newer switches, in general, all provide this flexibility. All switches have login features that can be deployed on a majority of operations channels. Different switches have different levels of protection against password cracking. Time-out is a common feature among switches and resource control is available on a limited basis. Except for a few conspicuous exceptions, switches generally provide a security log and associated audit features

AB  - Over time, laws change to meet evolving social needs. Requirements engineers that develop software for regulated domains, such as healthcare or finance, must adapt their software as laws change to maintain legal compliance. In the United States, regulatory agencies will almost always release a proposed regulation, or rule, and accept comments from the public. The agency then considers these comments when drafting a final rule that will be binding on the regulated domain. Herein, we examine how these proposed rules evolve into final rules, and propose an Adaptability Framework. This framework can aid software engineers in predicting what areas of a proposed rule are most likely to evolve, allowing engineers to begin building towards the more stable sections of the rule. We develop the framework through a formative study using the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Security Rule and apply it in a summative study on the Health Information Technology: Initial Set of Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria for Electronic Health Record Technology.

AB  - MFP (Multi-Function Peripheral) is an embedded system that serves several functions including printing, copying, scanning, faxing, document storing, and etc. Recently, MFP is becoming a popular option for office workers due to its multi-functionality and economic efficiency. Furthermore, MFP is able to perform several functions such as USB printing, private job printing, stored job printing, and scan-to-server. Due to the rapid growth of MFP market, MFP is widely used in many workspaces. Therefore, if we can extract meaningful information from MFP's storage devices, it may be valuable evidences in digital forensic investigation. However, systematic forensic investigation about MFP has never been studied so far. In this paper, we describe a process for digital forensic examination of MFP and analyze the acquired data and effectively trace the use of MFP in the crime scene.

AB  - Database outsourcing is emerging as an important trend in which the data owners ship their data to external service provider. Since a service provider is not fully trusted, security and privacy are significant issues. They can be referred to as data confidentiality, user and data privacy, query assurance and secure auditing. Among them, secure auditing takes an important role to have a secure database outsourcing model. While audit log provides investigator information to assess past system activity, it often contains sensitive information. We need to protect it from unauthorized parties while making it still efficiently searchable by authorized ones. In this paper, we propose a novel searchable encryption scheme, named PEKS-PM, based on pseudo inverse matrix, which enables a trusted party to give the service provider's server the ability to test whether a given keyword appears in log records but the server learns nothing about the keyword and the log content. Our encryption scheme is based mainly on linear matrix operations therefore the complexity is low. We prove that our proposed encryption scheme is secure and efficient, comparing with an encryption scheme based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption.

AB  - Log event correlation is an effective means of detecting system faults and security breaches encountered in information technology environments. Centralized, database-driven log event correlation is common, but suffers from flaws such as high network bandwidth utilization, significant requirements for system resources, and difficulty in detecting certain suspicious behaviors. Distributed event correlation is often assumed to be superior, but no research effort has been made which quantitatively evaluates its advantages and disadvantages. This research presents a distributed event correlation system which performs security event detection, and evaluates it experimentally, compared with a centralized alternative. The comparison measures the value in distributed event correlation by considering network bandwidth utilization, detection capability and database query efficiency. The implementation of these advantages allows a 99% reduction of network syslog traffic in the low accountability case. In addition, the system detects every implemented malicious use case, with a low false positive rate.

AB  - This paper proposes the design of multi-user authentication in the multi-application based environment and role-based access control by using PKI Authentication and X.509 privilege management infrastructure (PMI). A binding model of RBAC authorization based on attribute certificate (AC) and public key certificate (PKC) is presented. Especially, the way of attribute mapping between PKC, bridge AC, and role AC is illustrated. In addition, the activity-based policy enforcement is introduced to make the system respond to malicious activities more appropriately. At a core, the multi agent system approach is applied to automate the flexible and effective management of user authentication, role delegation as well as system accountability. Finally, we reported our ongoing implementation status and demonstrated that our proposed model is a potential solution to support strong authentication and dynamic authorization in the multi-user and multi-application environment.

AB  - This paper proposes a hybrid model of an authentication technique and a role based access control (RBAC) based on X.509 public key certificate and attribute certificate. With attribute certificate the user role is bound to an identity of the public key certificate in which the permissions are assigned to the holder. A mapping model of RBAC authorization and authentication is presented. In addition, we also deal with the issue of system service disruption and recovery as well as an activity-based policy. With our proposed model, the full authentication, authorization, and accountability (AAA) are supported. We apply the multi agent system concept to facilitate the authentication and the authorization based on the PKI infrastructure. Finally, the project called AmTRUE (authentication management and trusted role-based authorization in multi-application and multi-user environment) has been developed to implement our research idea.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has regulations regarding software development process controls and data provenance tracking. A key unanswered problem is the identification of which data changes are significant given a workflow model for image trial management. We report on the results of our study of provenance tracking requirements and define an architecture and software development process that meets U.S. regulatory requirements using open source software components.

The goal with this phase of the work is to implement the proposed method and evaluate the forensic validity of the method under real-world conditions. This paper discusses that implementation and the ability for the generated authentication logs and access fingerprints to both identify malicious activity and identify the source of this activity. While work has been done to develop secure log files, i.e., making them tamper resistant, there has been no prior work to ensure they are forensically valid.

AB  - One major problem faced by end-users and administrators of computational grid environments arise in connection with the usability of the security mechanisms usually deployed in these environments, in particular identity management. Many of the existing computational grid environments use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and X.509 digital certificates as a corner stone for their security architectures. However, security solutions based on PKI have to be usable to be effective otherwise they will not provide the intended protection. This paper presents the Audited Credential Delegation (ACD), a user-centric security identity management solution that accommodates users and resource providers security requirements including authentication, authorisation and auditing security goals from the design level. The proposed architecture removes any association between users and digital certificates, which is the source of the grid usability problem, while addressing resource providers concerns with regards to accountability. A prototype of this architecture has been implemented in Java and Web Services technologies using the recommendations of the Open Web Application Security consortium (OWASP) for developing secure software. It is currently being tested on TeraGrid, NGS and DEISA grid infrastructures and a detailed usability study is underway.

AB  - In classified information system, network security is often described as the cornerstone, and network components (such as routers and switches) are central assets. However, security management is usually based on IOS command only, which may cause the loss of network assurance. This article described the application of AAA security management in certain classified information network environment. To evaluate the enhancement the security protection, we compared the meet of standard for protection of state secrets, account security, log security, operation and audit facilitation by a designed prospective, randomized and compared study. The results showed that the AAA group was in accordance with standard for protection of state secrets, meanwhile AAA security management could provide safer account, more traceable log, and less time-consuming operation and audit. Based on the results, we strongly recommended that AAA security management should be widely applied to classified network.

AB  - Today's growing number of security threats to computers and networks also increase the importance of log inspections to support the detection of possible breaches. The investigation and assessment of security incidents becomes more and more a daily business. Further, the manual log analysis is essentially in the context of developing signatures for intrusion detection systems (IDS), which allow for an automated defense against security attacks or incidents. But the analysis of log data in the context of fo-rensic investigations and IDS signature development is a tedious and time-consuming task, due to the large amount of textual data. Moreover, this task requires a skilled knowledge to differentiate between the important and the non-relevant information. In this paper, we propose an approach for log resp. audit data representation, which aims at simplifying the analysis process for the security officer. For this purpose audit data and existing relations between audit events are represented graphically in a three-dimensional space. We describe a general approach for analyzing and exploring audit or log data in the context of this presentation paradigm. Further, we introduce our tool, which implements this approach and demonstrate the strengths and benefits of this presentation and exploration form.

AB  - Information security metrics are very important to guide the direction for measuring the effectiveness of security controls in compliance with the information security standards. However, lack of method to guide organization in choosing the technical security metrics may cause technical security control objectives and capabilities failed. This research proposes a model of technical security metrics to measure the effectiveness of network security management, such as network security controls and services such as firewall and Intrusion Detection Prevention System (IDPS) in the protection of Supervisory and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The methodology used is Plan-Do-Check-Act process model. The proposed technical security metric provides guidance for SCADA owners in complying with requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS) standard. The proposed model should be able to provide a comprehensive measurement and prove the effectiveness of ISO/IEC 27004 ISMS Measurement standard.

AB  - The VAX security kernel, a prototype security kernel implemented as a virtual machine monitor (VMM) for the VAX architecture, is capable of emulating one or more virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine allowing multiple copies of virtual machine operating systems to execute concurrently. The system supports both VMS and ULTRIX as virtual machine operating systems. A fundamental component of any security kernel is the ability to produce an audit trial of security relevant events. While there are numerous examples of auditing subsystems at the DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) C2 or B1 level, there is much less experience with the requirements at the B2 level and above. The design and implementation of the VAX security kernel auditing facility, built to satisfy the requirements at the A1 level, are described

AB  - We focus on dynamic monitoring of security and privacy policies in service oriented architectures (SOAs) based systems. In a service oriented system both the internal and the external services may easily interact with each other, which makes the establishment and the enforcement of the privacy policies and the rules across the systems increasingly challenging. We introduce efficient and flexible methods for auditing such systems by leveraging the middleware platform capabilities. The auditing methods allow for two different types of audits, the static audits and the dynamic audits. The static audits find out whether a process pattern that is defined by the audit has been executed in the system. The dynamic audits, however, find out on-the-fly whether any of the system policies are being violated as the service process flows are still in execution in the system. We also present the effectiveness of the dynamic monitoring that we have developed to support demanding requirements of the dynamic audits.

AB  - The authors discusses Wisdom and Sense (W&amp;S), a computer security anomaly detection system. W&amp;S is statistically based. It automatically generates rules from historical data and, in terms of those rules, identifies computer transactions that are at variance with historically established usage patterns. Issues addressed include how W&amp;S generates rules from a necessarily small sample of all possible transactions, how W&amp;S deals with inherently categorical data, and how W&amp;S assists system security officers in their review of audit logs. Preliminary results with W&amp;S show that the software does periodically detect anomalies of high interest even in data though to be free of such events

AB  - We propose an abstract model of business processes for the purpose of (i) evaluating privacy policy in light of the goals of the process and (ii) developing automated support for privacy policy compliance and audit. In our model, agents that send and receive tagged personal information are assigned organizational roles and responsibilities. We present approaches and algorithms for determining whether a business process design simultaneously achieves privacy and the goals of the organization (utility). The model also allows us to develop a notion of minimal exposure of personal information, for a given process. We investigate the problem of auditing with inexact information and develop methods to identify a set of potentially culpable individuals when privacy is breached. The audit methods draw on traditional causality concepts to reduce the effort needed to search audit logs for irresponsible actions.

However, it becomes challenging to hold super users accountable since they can erase any trace of their activities. This paper proposes an accountable administration model for operating systems where all system administrators can be accounted for even if they are untrustworthy. The model is implemented in Linux, a real world operating system.

It concentrates on those architectural structures-whether hardware or software-that are necessary to support information protection. The paper develops in three main sections. Section I describes desired functions, design principles, and examples of elementary protection and authentication mechanisms. Any reader familiar with computers should find the first section to be reasonably accessible. Section II requires some familiarity with descriptor-based computer architecture. It examines in depth the principles of modern protection architectures and the relation between capability systems and access control list systems, and ends with a brief analysts of protected subsystems and protected objects. The reader who is dismayed by either the prerequisites or the level of detail in the second section may wish to skip to Section III, which reviews the state of the art and current research projects and provides suggestions for further reading.

AB  - Measuring security is an important step in creating and deploying secure applications. In order to efficiently measure the level of security that an application provides, three problems need to be solved: obviously metrics need to be available, a suitable metrics framework needs to be chosen and implemented, and the resulting measurements need to be interpreted. This work focuses on the second and third problem. We propose an approach to facilitate the selection and integration of appropriate security metrics, and to support the aggregation and interpretation of measurements. Our approach associates security metrics to security patterns, and we exploit the relationships between security patterns and security objectives to enable the interpretation of measurements. The approach is illustrated in a case study.

AB  - Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the de facto standard for preventing eavesdropping, tampering or message forgery of higher-risk Internet communications, for example when making a payment. At heart TLS is a stateful cryptographic protocol built around a public key infrastructure (PKI). However TLS is configurable; at one extreme it provides little protection and at the other end of the scale it provides protection against most threats to an Internet communication. In practice the ldquoIrdquo part of PKI is often not available at the client end so only the server end is authenticated. In this paper an optional TLS extension is proposed that dispenses with the need for the client to be registered with a PKI registration authority and instead uses a payment card to authenticate the user. This facilitates wider use of the available TLS services and can provide additional security services: enhanced privacy and certain non-repudiation services, for example.

AB  - A growing number of applications in the Internet are making use of X.509 public key certificates. Examples include security protocols such as SSL (used in web browsers), IPsec (used in firewalls and desktop computers), S/MIME (a secure e-mail protocol), and SET (the electronic commerce credit card transaction protocol). The public key certificates employed by the applications are created by Certification Authorities (CAs), that vouch for the binding of various attributes (e.g., identity) to a public key. Thus security of these applications is dependent on the security of the CA function. This paper examines security for CAs. It begins with a characterization of security requirements for CAs and continues with an exploration of the wide range of attacks that can be mounted against CAs. Included are attacks against network communications, against the operating systems used by CAs, &ldquo;close-in&rdquo; technical attacks against CA components (including cryptographic modules), and even misbehavior by human operators. The paper concludes with an examination of three approaches to implementing CA cryptographic support functions, analyzing each relative to the attack scenarios developed earlier in the paper

AB  - A dramatic shift is underway in how organizations use computer storage. This shift will have a profound impact on storage system design. The requirement for storage of traditional transactional data is being supplemented by the necessity to store information for long periods. In 2005, a total of 2,700 petabytes of storage was allocated worldwide for information that required long-term retention, and this amount is expected to grow to an estimated 27,200 petabytes by 2010. In this paper, we review the requirements for long-term storage of data and describe an innovative approach for developing a highly scalable and flexible archive storage system using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Such a system is expected to be capable of preserving data for decades, providing efficient policy-based management of the data, and allowing efficient search and access to data regardless of data content or location.

The focus is on how the system's hardware, microcode, and software are aimed at meeting A1-level security requirements while maintaining the standard interfaces and applications of the VMS and ULTRIX-32 operating systems. The VAX security kernel supports multiple concurrent virtual machines on a single VAX system, providing isolation and controlled sharing of sensitive data. Rigorous engineering standards were applied during development to comply with the assurance requirements for verification and configuration management. The VAX security kernel has been developed with a heavy emphasis on performance and system management tools. The kernel performs sufficiently well that much of its development was carried out in virtual machines running on the kernel itself, rather than in a conventional time-sharing system

AB  - Large scale distributed systems comprising many administration domains have been well-researched. An example is a national health service, with domains such as primary care practices, hospitals, specialist clinics, etc. A new and relatively unexplored scenario is technology-assisted living, in which domains are small, dynamically created, and is associated with units of personal living. There is a great deal of commercial interest in providing technology to support assisted living, but services are created in isolation. We explore how such services could be integrated with a system that can ensure security and privacy. We propose to audit both system behaviour and the actions of principals, holding particular regard to the fulfillment of their obligations, to establish a computational expression of the trust to be associated with each principal

While the security of the embedded devices during the operation of the system is naturally the focus of security considerations, the security of the engineering framework is often overlooked. In this paper, we model the trust boundaries of a typical engineering tool used in an IACS, identify security risks in this context, suggest mitigation techniques for end users, and finally propose an architecture that allows to implement secure engineering frameworks.

AB  - Establishing electronic exchange of information among collaborating organisations is a key goal in the public and private sector today. The desire to reduce costs while providing higher quality of service are two main drivers for this development. Confidential information about individual clients is often part of the information to be exchanged. Today, the handling of such information is governed by increasingly stringent privacy legislations. Ensuring compliance of such legislations during cross-organisational information mediation requires advanced middleware mechanisms. In this paper, we analyse requirements on such mechanisms and describe their prototypical realisation in the application domain of health care

AB  - Logs are the files which contain the information about all the events occurring on the system. Logs have been playing a vital role in providing all kinds of information which can be used for several purposes like detecting a suspicious behaviour over the system. The aim of this paper is to study, analyse and generate results by observing host. Log files consist of different header information which can be further used to determine if any kind of malicious activity is discovered then that activity can be traced and blocked.

AB  - The authors describe an implementation of an integrity-supporting discretionary access control mechanism-the capabilities knowledge base (CKB)-as an extension to the Clark and Wilson model (1987). They advocate using the audit trail to the fullest extent possible, not as just a passive collection of system events, but also as an active resource for solving the division-of-tasks problem that results from separation of duty. They emphasize that CKB can enforce the separation of duty as described in the Clark and Wilson model and therefore adds a measure of protection to information against unauthorized modification. This use of a knowledge base implementation is perceived as the only viable technical solution to the division-of-tasks problem. A high-level design for a CKB in support of data integrity is presented. The current implementation of CKB provides the functionality to import audit events and capability requests to the inferencing mechanism

AB  - Ideally, information systems security enables management to have confidence that their computational systems provide the information requested and expected, while denying accessibility to those who have no right to it. The analysis of incidents resulting in damage to information systems show that most losses were still due to errors or omissions by authorized users, actions of disgruntled employees, and an increase in external penetrations of systems by outsiders. Traditional controls are normally inadequate in these cases or are focused on the wrong threat, resulting in the exposure of vulnerability. Security is a critical parameter for the expansion and wide usage of agent technology. A threat model is constructed and subsequently the basic techniques to deal effectively with these threats are analyzed. This paper presents a dynamic, extensible, configurable and interoperable security architecture for mobile agent systems. It is explained how this architecture can be used to tackle a big part of security threats. All the components of the security architecture are analyzed while we also argue for the benefits they offer.

AB  - The rise of many kinds of grid systems, and associated security threats, makes very necessary the provision of trustworthy services for audit and logging. However, existing solutions tend to put little emphasis on the security of logging. We present a number of use cases where the logs have security properties in their own rights, and so the logs themselves are highly privileged: hence, these need to be integrity and confidentiality protected while being generated, accessed, reconciled and analysed with distributed services spanning across multiple administrative domains. We derive a common set of secure logging requirements to address the security gaps which exist between these use cases and existing solutions.From the requirements, we propose a novel logging architecture for the grid based on virtual machine (VM) isolation and trusted computing capabilities: a small number of privileged driver VMs trigger all trusted logging requests and forward them to the secure logging service running within the log security manager. The logging service verifies the integrity of the log data and the security configurations of these driver VMs (log generators) before storing the logs.

AB  - Because it is generally not possible to prevent the destruction or alteration of data when objects are stored or transmitted outside the security perimeter of a TCB (trusted computer base), the emphasis is placed on detecting any illicit data, including the results of computer viruses and Trojan Horse programs, using cryptographic checksums and digital signature techniques. It is concluded that a mandatory integrity policy consisting of the Biba hierarchical integrity policy extended to include integrity categories and multilevel integrity-trusted subjects, plus a discretionary integrity policy that uses a digital signature mechanism incorporated in a file label to indicate who created or produced that file, can provide integrity controls very well-suited to the networking environment

Particular focus is on how the system's hardware, microcode, and software are aimed at meeting A1-level security requirements while maintaining the standard interfaces and applications of the VMS and ULTRIX-32 operating systems. The VAX security kernel supports multiple concurrent virtual machines on a single VAX system, providing isolation and controlled sharing of sensitive data. Rigorous engineering standards were applied during development to comply with the assurance requirements for verification and configuration management. The VAX security kernel was developed with a heavy emphasis on performance and on system management tools. The kernel performs sufficiently well that all of its development can be now carried out in virtual machines running on the kernel itself, rather than in a conventional time-sharing system

AB  - Ensuring the trustworthiness of data retrieved from a database is of utmost importance to users. The correctness of data stored in a database is defined by the faithful execution of only valid (authorized) transactions. In this paper we address the question of whether it is necessary to trust a database server in order to trust the data retrieved from it. The lack of trust arises naturally if the database server is owned by a third party, as in the case of cloud computing. It also arises if the server may have been compromised, or there is a malicious insider. In particular, we reduce the level of trust necessary in order to establish the authenticity and integrity of data at an untrusted server. Earlier work on this problem is limited to situations where there are no updates to the database, or all updates are authorized and vetted by a central trusted entity. This is an unreasonable assumption for a truly dynamic database, as would be expected in many business applications, where multiple clients can update data without having to check with a central server that approves of their changes. We identify the problem of ensuring trustworthiness of data at an untrusted server in the presence of transactional updates that run directly on the database, and develop the first solutions to this problem. Our solutions also provide indemnity for an honest server and assured provenance for all updates to the data. We implement our solution in a prototype system built on top of Oracle with no modifications to the database internals. We also provide an empirical evaluation of the proposed solutions and establish their feasibility.

Emphasis is on software mechanisms which can be implemented on current computer systems. The approach is based on capabilities that limit the potential damage of undetected Trojan horses in development tools, and type managers that control access to software objects

AB  - Unified enterprise application security is a newly emerging approach for providing protection against application level attacks. Conventional application security approaches that embed security into each critical application results into scattered security mechanism, which is not only difficult to manage but also creates security loopholes. Therefore, new unified enterprise application security concept is evolving in the industry that consists of centralized authentication, access control, incident response and auditing. Industries such as Computer Associate, Cerebit, Entrust, Evidian, IBM Tivoli, Netegrity, Ohlix and SunOne have comes up with the identity and access management solutions that are based on this concept. Significant amount of misunderstanding exists in the industry and research community about appropriate features of such a unified product. Therefore we have proposed new enterprise application security (EAS) comparison framework to compare existing enterprise application security products. This framework helps an enterprise in selecting appropriate application security product. From comparison we found that Computer Associate and Netegrity solutions are the best available solutions, however none of the current available solutions are providing complete enterprise application security. Therefore we have proposed new unified enterprise application security architecture. This architecture provides all basic information security and other critical services such as, auditing, reporting, authentication, access control, confidentiality, integrity, commitment to standards, incident response, scalability. flexibility, manageability, and compliance of regulatory mandates.

AB  - Although wireless sensor network is considered as one of promising technologies for ubiquitous computing environment, more researches for re-authentication of mobile nodes in wireless sensor network are required due to user mobility, one of important properties in ubiquitous computing environment. As the citizens in a city can be mobile user in wireless sensor network and the resource of the sensor nodes is limited, scalability of re-authentication is important. In other words, re-authentication with less communication cost should be proposed. In this paper, we suggest an efficient method of membership verification for re-authentication of mobile node and show the performance analysis of our membership verification. Using this method, we propose an efficient and scalable reauthentication protocol over wireless sensor network. Also, we provide performance and security analysis of our protocol.

AB  - Governments worldwide are enacting data protection laws that restrict the disclosure and processing of personal information. These laws impose administrative and financial burdens on companies that manage personal information and may hinder the legitimate and valuable sharing and analysis of this information. In this paper we describe an integrated set of technologies, known as the Hippocratic Database (HDB), which enables compliance with security and privacy regulations without impeding the legitimate flow of information. HDB's Control Center allows companies to specify fine-grained disclosure policies based on the role of the user, the purpose of the access, the intended recipient, and other disclosure conditions. Its Active Enforcement component transparently enforces these policies by transforming user queries in a middleware layer to ensure that the database returns only policy-compliant information. HDB's Compliance Auditing system efficiently tracks all database accesses and allows auditors to formulate precise audit queries to monitor compliance with privacy and security policies. In this paper, we outline the basic architecture of the HDB solution, discuss the advantages of our approach, and illustrate the features of each component with practical compliance scenarios from the financial services industry.

AB  - A-priori access control techniques allow granting access to a set of predefined agents. In some processes, we cannot define in advance the set of authorized agents because the characteristics of the process instance determine activity assignment. A-posteriori access control allows access to many agents who claim being authorized. It implements an audit process permitting to check the behavior of the different agents in the system. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a-posteriori access control and we provide an approach allowing modeling an auditable process by using Business Process Management Notation (BPMN). We express audit requirements through text annotations. Finally, we provide an example from the banking context to illustrate an auditable process.

AB  - Authorization logics provide a principled and flexible approach to specifying access control policies. One of their compelling benefits is that a proof in the logic is evidence that an access-control decision has been made in accordance with policy. Using such proofs for auditing reduces the trusted computing base and enables the ability to detect flaws in complex authorization policies. Moreover, the proof structure is itself useful, because proof normalization can yield information about the relevance of policy statements. Untrusted, but well-typed, applications that access resources through an appropriate interface must obey the access control policy and create proofs useful for audit. This paper presents AURA_0, an authorization logic based on a dependently-typed variant of DCC and proves the metatheoretic properties of subject-reduction and normalization. It shows the utility of proof-based auditing in a number of examples and discusses several pragmatic issues that must be addressed in this context.

AB  - Protecting implantable medical devices against attack without compromising patient health requires balancing security and privacy goals with traditional goals such as safety and utility. Implantable medical devices monitor and treat physiological conditions within the body. These devices - including pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs), drug delivery systems, and neurostimulators - can help manage a broad range of ailments, such as cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. IMDs' pervasiveness continues to swell, with upward of 25 million US citizens currently reliant on them for life-critical functions. Growth is spurred by geriatric care of the aging baby-boomer generation, and new therapies continually emerge for chronic conditions ranging from pediatric type 1 diabetes to anorgasmia and other sexual dysfunctions. Moreover, the latest IMDs support delivery of telemetry for remote monitoring over long-range, high-bandwidth wireless links, and emerging devices will communicate with other interoperating IMDs.

AB  - Most computers today are insecure because security is costly in terms of user inconvenience and foregone features, and people are unwilling to pay the price. Real-world security depends more on punishment than on locks, but it's hard to even find network attackers, much less punish them. The basic elements of security are authentication, authorization, and auditing: the gold standard. The idea of one principal speaking for another is the key to doing these uniformly across the Internet.

AB  - Modern mobile devices are able to run a wide range of thirdparty/service provider applications that provide users with a variety of attractive services. These applications have their own databases on the mobile device; user data pertaining to the application are stored there. The popularity comes with a price: attackers are interested in exploiting the weaknesses of the mobile systems to manipulate personal information of users via malicious code or malware. Another problem is that mobile devices are often stolen or misplaced and stored data, which users value more than the hardware, compromised. We propose a consolidated logging scheme that reflects all transactions performed on all databases of mobile applications. Only a part of this logis stored on the mobile device, thus addressing the conflict between space limitation in these devices and the space requirement of logging; yet, it is tamper-resistant and enables restoration of data through logging. We formalize our claims and explain how our scheme addresses some important problems created by malware and theft.

AB  - Sharing data within grid environments always results in losing control over data usage. If the shared information is medical data, this violates laws as specified in HIPAA, because access to such data must be reconstructible and needs to be tightly controlled. To comply with these regulations it must be guaranteed, that each data access and modification is recorded to produce audit trails. The provided solution introduces a new concept for virtual grid computing environments consisting of secure virtual machines, hosting data and indemnifying thorough audit trails by logging every data interaction, solving the problem of traceability and side-access.

AB  - This article describes a vision for countering terrorism through information and privacy-protection technologies. This vision was initially imagined as part of a research and development (R&amp;D) agenda sponsored by DARPA in 2002 in the form of the information awareness office (IAO) and the total information awareness (TIA) program. It includes a critical focus and commitment to delicately balancing national security objectives with privacy and civil liberties. We strongly believe that the two don't conflict and that the ultimate solution lies in utilizing information technologies for counterterrorism along with privacy-protection technologies to safeguard civil liberties, and twining them together with coordinated policies that bind them to their intended use

AB  - Intrusion detection is a new, retrofit approach for providing a sense of security in existing computers and data networks, while allowing them to operate in their current "open" mode. The goal of intrusion detection is to identify unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. The intrusion detection problem is becoming a challenging task due to the proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks since the increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders and makes it easier for intruders to avoid identification. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are based on the beliefs that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user and that many unauthorized actions are detectable. Typically, IDSs employ statistical anomaly and rulebased misuse models in order to detect intrusions. A number of prototype IDSs have been developed at several institutions, and some of them have also been deployed on an experimental basis in operational systems. In the present paper, several host-based and network-based IDSs are surveyed, and the characteristics of the corresponding systems are identified. The host-based systems employ the host operating system's audit trails as the main source of input to detect intrusive activity, while most of the network-based IDSs build their detection mechanism on monitored network traffic, and some employ host audit trails as well. An outline of a statistical anomaly detection algorithm employed in a typical IDS is also included.<<ETX>>

AB  - A user's behaviour for using a specific web service on Internet, like her/his biometric information, can be used to identify the use. In many cases, the user behaviour represented as a set of attributes can be classified as either normal or anomalous. This value or in conjunction with other attributes of the user can be used to authorise the user of having access to the web service. To a certain extent, it can protect against identity theft since it may be very difficult to impersonate on behaviours of using Internet. This article presents how a user's behaviour for using a particular web service is observed and classified; how this behaviour attribute is securely transported across network; and how it used for access authorisation decision.

AB  - A network providing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service requires many network elements. Each network element may have its own set of security capabilities, but not all security capabilities on all network elements are necessary at the same time for a given network configuration. An end-to-end network view is necessary to choose appropriate security capabilities while minimizing network overhead. For VoIP, using an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) core network and wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi<sup>&#x2217;</sup>) access, the service provider can offer the feature functionality of the core network to both enterprise and residential customers simultaneously. However, both market segments provide their own set of unique security challenges, and what is appropriate for one market segment is not necessarily appropriate for the other. This paper explores various security implications for both of these market segments and proposes options for securing each network configuration. Security aspects of the control plane, bearer plane, and management plane are considered. &#x00A9; 2007 Alcatel-Lucent.

AB  - In most of companies or organizations, logs play important role in information security. However, the common security mechanism only backup logs, it is not able to find out traces of intruders because the hacker who is able to intrudes the security mechanism of organization would try to alter logs or destroy important intrusion evidences making it impossible to preserve evidence using traditional log security strategies. Thus, logs are not considered as evidence to prove the damage. In that case, digital evidence lacks in terms of completeness which makes it difficult to perform computer forensics operations. In order to maintain the completeness and reliability of evidence for later forensic procedures and intrusion detection, the study applies concepts of steganography to logs forensics, for which even intrusion altered records will be kept as well. Comparing to traditional security strategies, this study proposes a better logging mechanism to ensure the completeness of logs. Furthermore, the study will assist in intrusion detection through alteration behavior, and help in forensic operations.

AB  - Peer-to-peer (P2P) mesh based streaming systems have gained widespread use for multicasting of audio and video. In approaches based on BitTorrent, members of the swarm share their content availability through gossiping, and redistribute file pieces cached locally. However, such systems are vulnerable to cheating attacks such as fake reporting, selective omission, fake block attack, and neighbor selection attack. These attacks will severely impact quality of service, waste resources, and discourage cooperation among participants. A defense mechanism, called AntiLiar, is proposed for defending against cheating attacks in mesh based streaming. AntiLiar uses a secure progress log that consists of commitments and one-time signatures, and maintains consistency for an expanded neighbor view. Experimental results demonstrate that AntiLiar minimizes required costs, and improves service quality over alternatives in the face of cheating attacks.

In this paper, we discuss the network forensics behaviors systematically from both the technical view and legal view. The goal of discussion is to outline the formalization and standardization of the network forensics behaviors. To our knowledge, this is the first time to comprehensively discuss the network forensics model and its fundamental fields, such as taxonomy, conceptual model, legal principles, key techniques, canonical processes and its accessory facilities and systems - network forensics system architecture and deployment. These discussions will give the guidance to the standardization of network forensics processes and the implementation of prototype system.

Our contributions are designed to better protect the patient's data and to increase the functionality and interoperability of smart cards in health care. Our solution, called SAMSON, consists of two types of smart cards. The first, a security card, is issued to all personnel within any medical organization, while the second, the medical card, is issued to patients and used to securely store and retrieve health care information. These smart cards are being tested within a 14 hospital federated consortium in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

AB  - Today's techniques for controlling access to software artifacts are limited to restricting access to whole files and directories. But when a company's access control policy does not match a project's existing physical modularization, these techniques require either an all-or-nothing approach or re-modularization of the files and directories. The increased maintenance overhead this brings to project administration can lead to unimplemented or insufficient developer access control and an increased risk of insider security incidents (e.g., theft of intellectual property). We have created a tool (GitBAC) to provide access control of software artifacts using a crosscutting concern instead of artifact modularization. Our method provides fine-grained access control of artifacts and accommodates flexible access control policies.

AB  - In grid collaborations, scientists use middleware to execute computational experiments, visualize results, and securely share data on resources ranging from desktop machines to supercomputers. While there has been significant effort in authentication and authorization for these distributed infrastructures, it is still difficult to determine, post-facto, exactly what information might have been accessed, what operations might have occurred, and for what reasons. To address this problem, we have designed and implemented a secure logging infrastructure for grid data access. We uniquely leverage and extend XACML with new capabilities so that data owners can specify logging policies and these policies can be used to engage logging mechanisms to record events of interest to the data owners. A case study based on GridFTP.NET is presented and analyzed, utilizing both local storage of log records and remote storage via SAWS, an independently developed secure audit Web service. We show that with relatively little performance overhead, data owners are provided with new flexibility for determining the post-facto conditions under which their grid data was accessed

AB  - The growth of the Internet has been accompanied by the growth of Web services (e.g. e-commerce, e-health). This proliferation of Web services and the increasing regulatory and legal requirements for personal privacy have fueled the need to protect the personal privacy of Web service users. We advocate a privacy policy negotiation approach to protecting personal privacy (Yee and Korba, 2003; ). We provided semiautomated approaches for deriving personal privacy policies (Yee and Korba, 2004). However, it is evident that approaches are also needed to ensure that providers of Web services comply with the privacy policies of service users. In this paper, we examine privacy legislation to derive requirements for privacy policy compliance systems. We then propose an architecture for a privacy policy compliance system that satisfies the requirements and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed architecture.

AB  - This paper describes the design of a decision support module (DSM) for an intrusion detection system, which can provide active detection and automated response support during intrusions. The primary function of the decision support module is to provide recommended actions and alternatives and the implications of each recommended action. In the decision support module, the GA (genetic algorithm) was run over a subset of the data, called the training data, and then tested over the entire data set to test real-world performance. The model generated by this GA was based on a new method of data analysis for the intrusion detection problem. Each node in the model's decision tree was designed to hold a randomized coefficient for the data, so that this coefficient multiplied by the data would yield a weight for the certainty of whether a certain record was an attack or not. The coefficients were based on ephemeral random constants (ERC), random numbers generated by the GA specific to mathematical modeling.

AB  - Since the need of the communication data in revealing the crime are just emerged after the event detected, communication data retention for lawful interception (LI) are really demanded. This paper aim to give recommendation for telecommunication regulatory body in making communication data retention regulation. This research describes points of recommendation to National Telecommunication Regulatory Body in establishing LI data retention regulation which conducted by the Communication Service Provider in the country. These recommendations are very useful for countries that do not have relevant regulations of this field. This paper suggests that propose data retention system must have an ability to run administrative function, data collection function and data management function. Each function should maintain such a log. Administrative log has to keep warrant information include target identity and date start, and the duration of data retention needed. In telecommunication infrastructure target are either MSISDN, IMEI or IMSI. For communication data through IP mechanism, target is either email address, account name or IP address. Information item that have to be retained are include subscriber data, usage data and traffic data, equipment data, network element data, additional service data and the call contents. If storage capacity are not fully provided yet, the retention for data that need the largest storage space such as video and file might be less priority. Regulatory Body must determine the data retention format based on handover interface. To prevent abuse of data, regulation should put clauses that obligate each party to delete data longer than retention period. Besides this paper recommends decentralize location of storage media, apart from operational system and have a hot site backup.

AB  - Policies show great potential as a way to control the behavior of complex computer systems. In the case of authorization decisions in large distributed systems, policies offer the potential to abstract away from the details of who is allowed to access which services, under which conditions. This layer of abstraction is both a challenge and an opportunity: policy-driven distributed authorization systems may be more manageable, scalable, available, and secure than previous approaches---or they may be just the opposite. In the talk that accompanies this paper paper, we survey the status of the field and its near- term prospects, from both a theoretical and a practical perspective, and point out the major barriers to the adoption of policy-driven authorization systems in industry.

A citizen can reconstruct the trail of such a process and verify its status if he is the subject of that process. Reconstruction is based on hand-overs, special types of log events, that link data stored by multiple logging servers, which are not necessarily trusted. Our scheme is privacy-friendly in the sense that only the authorised subject, i.e. the citizen, can link the different log entries related to one specific process. The scheme is also auditable; it allows logging servers to show that they behave according to a certain policy.

AB  - Mobile agents can provide many benefits to the development of distributed applications. But the mobile agent system will face some security threat since it will run in an opening network environment. In this paper, we analyzed the security threats in mobile agent system and provided a method to build the trusted connect between entities in mobile agent environment. This method uses the trusted platform module in trusted computing platform as the trusted base. When a mobile agent wants to migrate to another platform, it should use a trusted connect between the source host and the goal host. The agent and agent platform can trust with each other. This method will be helpful to build a trusted computing environment for the mobile agent system.

AB  - Modern industrial communication networks are increasingly based on open protocols and platforms that are also used in the office IT and Internet environment. This reuse facilitates development and deployment of highly connected systems, but also makes the communication system vulnerable to electronic attacks. This paper gives an overview of IT security issues in industrial automation systems which are based on open communication systems. First, security objectives, electronic attack methods, and the available countermeasures for general IT systems are described. General security objectives and best practices are listed. Particularly for the TCP/IP protocol suite, a wide range of cryptography-based secure communication protocols is available. The paper describes their principles and scope of application. Next, we focus on industrial communication systems, which have a number of security-relevant characteristics distinct from the office IT systems. Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control. The paper describes the status of relevant specifications and implementations for a number of standardized automation protocols. Finally, we illustrate the application of security concepts and tools by brief case studies describing security issues in the configuration and operation of substations, plants, or for remote access.

AB  - Privilege is defined as the basic rights that oneself can refuse to testify or withhold a document in litigation. How can this be implemented in digital forensics investigation? The first step is to apply the encryption technology to protect privileged data systematically and automatically. A proposed scheme for balancing privilege and digital forensics investigation is also depicted in this paper. In this scheme, a systematic role-based digital forensics framework - FORZA is used for linking the encryption technology and privilege requirement together.

AB  - In order to solve security problems in web-based information systems in the large-scale distributed environment, we design a comprehensive security policy. We realize the single entry mechanism of multi-system access by using the single-sign-on, create identity authentication mechanism of high-reliability and security based on China's second-generation ID card. We also propose the cross-domain setup and its strategies for the access from scattered information systems. This paper will show the access control policy which combines dynamic and static methods, bring up a combination of coarse-grained and fine-grained access control strategy through refining digital objects, operations and rights. Besides we realize encrypted data communication for VPN by using SSL encryption technology to make data encapsulation. Considering the database security, we adopt access control technology, separation control technology, encryption technology, data flow control technology, reasoning control technology and backup technology. We then track and check all users who accessed or tried to access the system by using the system audit, use the triple-right separation mechanism for reliable management to avoid the abuse of powerful rights owned by the system administrator.

AB  - Secure role based messaging (SRBM) augments messaging systems with role oriented communication in a secure manner. Role occupants can sign and decrypt messages on behalf of roles. This paper identifies the requirements of SRBM and recognises the need for: distributed key shares, fast membership revocation, mandatory security controls and detection of identity spoofing. A shared RSA scheme is constructed. RSA keys are shared and distributed to role occupants and role gate keepers. Role occupants and role gate keepers must cooperate together to use the key shares to sign and decrypt the messages. Role occupant signatures can be verified by an audit service. SRBM system architecture is developed to show the security related performance of the proposed scheme, which also demonstrates the implementation of fast membership revocation, mandatory security control and prevention of spoofing. It is shown that the proposed scheme has successfully coupled distributed security with mandatory security controls to realize secure role based messaging.

AB  - As cyber-crimes using personal information such as ID theft are increasing, there is a need for appropriate technology or law to protect privacy. To this end, the Korean Government established the Privacy Act on March 29th 2011. The Privacy Act prescribes a specification for dealing with privacy with the intention to protect personal information from being collected, leaked, misused, or abused so that it can improve rights and interests of the nation and eventually realize the dignity and value of man. The United States, Japan, Canada, and several countries of the EU have their own privacy law being established or revised. Although there must be differences depending on the circumstances of each country, the ultimate goal of the privacy law should be the same. Consequently, there might be the same or similar technical protection required by all these countries. Between the increasing interest in protecting personal information and the establishment of the Privacy Act, many industries are having relevant products released one after another. Customers without knowledge of the law and the product types cannot decide what they need. This paper intends to derive necessary security functions of a personal information security system based on the Common Criteria and analyze the limit of the products in order to make guidelines for privacy and information protection system.

AB  - The paper presents a new approach to representing and detecting computer penetrations in real time. The approach, called state transition analysis, models penetrations as a series of state changes that lead from an initial secure state to a target compromised state. State transition diagrams, the graphical representation of penetrations, identify precisely the requirements for and the compromise of a penetration and present only the critical events that must occur for the successful completion of the penetration. State transition diagrams are written to correspond to the states of an actual computer system, and these diagrams form the basis of a rule based expert system for detecting penetrations, called the state transition analysis tool (STAT). The design and implementation of a Unix specific prototype of this expert system, called USTAT, is also presented. This prototype provides a further illustration of the overall design and functionality of this intrusion detection approach. Lastly, STAT is compared to the functionality of comparable intrusion detection tools

AB  - With the complexity posed by user account management for organizations, the need to implement an effective user account management process to help address possible risks to information cannot be overstated. To this end, this paper focuses on the development of a conceptual framework for enterprise user account lifecycle management (EUALMF), to help small - medium size organizations more effectively implement user account management recommendations contained in the NIST SP 800-53 standard, COBIT 4.1/5 framework, as well as other standards and best practices. It is argued that the high-level nature of the NIST standard and COBIT framework may make it difficult for small-medium size organizations to effectively implement recommendations proposed, due to resource and financial constraints. The framework is designed to provide a level of flexibility that ensures it can be easily adapted to most IT environments, to help ensure the separation of duties, least privilege and need-to-know principles are enforced, as well as providing the right balance between technical and non-technical controls to help prevent single-point-of-failure. The need to carry out a risk assessment process for user accounts, implementing an audit process, as well as implementing a performance measure metric has also been highlighted.

AB  - Security patterns can be a valuable vehicle to design secure software. Several proposals have been advanced to improve the usability of security patterns. They often describe extra annotations to be included in the pattern documentation. This paper presents an empirical study that validates whether those proposals provide any real benefit for software architects. A controlled experiment has been executed with 90 master students, who have performed several design tasks involving the hardening of a software architecture via security patterns. The results show that annotations produce benefits in terms of a reduced number of alternatives that need to be considered during the selection of a suitable pattern. However, they do not reduce the time spent in the selection process.

AB  - In this paper we present PasS (privacy as a service); a set of security protocols for ensuring the privacy and legal compliance of customer data in cloud computing architectures. PasS allows for the secure storage and processing of users' confidential data by leveraging the tamper-proof capabilities of cryptographic coprocessors. Using tamper-proof facilities provides a secure execution domain in the computing cloud that is physically and logically protected from unauthorized access. PasS central design goal is to maximize users' control in managing the various aspects related to the privacy of sensitive data. This is achieved by implementing user-configurable software protection and data privacy mechanisms. Moreover, PasS provides a privacy feedback process which informs users of the different privacy operations applied on their data and makes them aware of any potential risks that may jeopardize the confidentiality of their sensitive information. To the best of our knowledge, PasS is the first practical cloud computing privacy solution that utilizes previous research on cryptographic coprocessors to solve the problem of securely processing sensitive data in cloud computing infrastructures.

AB  - Network-based attacks have become common and sophisticated. For this reason, intrusion detection systems are now shifting their focus from the hosts and their operating systems to the network itself. Network intrusion detection is challenging because network auditing produces large amounts of data, and different events related to a single intrusion may be visible in different places in the network. This paper presents network intrusion system, describes the design of a decision support module (DSM) for intrusion detection system, which can provide active detection and automated response support during intrusions. It is designed to be a sense and response system that can monitor various activities on the network. In particular, it simultaneously monitors networked computer's activities at different levels.

AB  - With the ever advancing technology of fast information processing, protecting data with only access control mechanisms is becoming increasingly difficult. If someone breaks into a database, the entire data will be compromised if it is in plaintext form. One quick remedy is to keep the data in encrypted form. However, encryption will make it difficult to do any operations on the data. This has prompted considerable research in the last decade and has led to various schemes of searchable encryption. It allows search over the encrypted data. There are various techniques which support different levels of querying, making it suitable for variety of applications. However, almost all of them are either symmetric-key or single-user schemes or require key sharing. Here, we are proposing a new scheme which will allow multiple users to encrypt, store and decrypt their own data, along with support for doing data searches over all the data by other users.

AB  - Contemporary information systems such as: eLearning, eUnivesity, eVoting, eHealth, etc., are frequently used and misused for irregular data changes (data tampering). Those facts force us to reconsider our security measures and find a way to improve them. Proving a computer crime act require very complicated processes which are based on digital evidence collecting, forensic analysis and investigation process. Forensic analysis of database systems is very specific and demanding task and therefore presents main inspiration for our research. In this paper we present the fact that classical methods of collecting digital evidence are not appropriate and efficient. In order to improve efficiency we propose combination of well know technology independent methods from database world and their application in field of forensic science. Also we are proposed some new research direction in this area.

AB  - We examine e-Healthcare security challenges in order to address the emerging needs of a national digital healthcare solution. New security concerns arise in transmitting and processing of electronic medical records, personal healthcare records, patient billing records, as well as public health alerts, across many parties with varying security, privacy and trust levels. Additional security requirements in e-Healthcare settings have to be formulated beyond traditional data networking services. Our results include an e-Healthcare security solution framework that enables multi-party participation, allows variable visibility into selective parts of data, and guarantees end-to-end security control.

AB  - Unified Enterprise application security is a new emerging approach for providing protection against application level attacks. Conventional application security approach that consists of embedding security into each critical application leads towards scattered security mechanism that is not only difficult to manage but also creates security loopholes. According to the CSI/FBI computer crime survey report, almost 80% of the security breaches come from authorized users. In this paper, we have worked on the concept of unified security model, which manages all security aspect from a single security window. The basic idea is to keep business functionality separate from security components of the application. Our main focus was on the designing of frame work for unified layer which supports single point of policy control, centralize logging mechanism, granular, context aware access control, and independent from any underlying authentication technology and authorization policy.

AB  - An effective method for detecting computer misuse is the automatic auditing and analysis of on-line user activity. This activity is reflected in the system audit record, by changes in the vulnerability posture of the system configuration, and in other evidence found through active testing of the system. In 1989 we started developing an automatic misuse detection system for the Integrated Computing Network (ICN) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Since 1990 this system has been operational, monitoring a variety of network systems and services. We call it the Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Reporter, or NADIR. During the last year and a half, we expanded NADIR to include processing of audit and activity records for the Cray UNICOS operating system. This new component is called the UNICOS Real-time NADIR, or UNICORN. UNICORN summarizes user activity and system configuration information in statistical profiles. In near real-time, it can compare current activity to historical profiles and test activity against expert rules that express our security policy and define improper or suspicious behavior. It reports suspicious behavior to security auditors and provides tools to aid in follow-up investigations. UNICORN is currently operational on four Crays in Los Alamos' main computing network, the ICN.

AB  - Stepping stone detection can be defined as a process to discover an intermediate host correlation that used by intruder. Most of the intruders cover their track by login into intermediate host first before execute the real attack. This intermediate hosts here known as stepping stone. This paper introduces a hybrid stepping stone detection method which combines the network-based and host-based stepping stone method. By taking the special capabilities of each method, solid stepping stone detection architecture has been produced. A great explanation regarding to the architecture has been done, together with the details of each chosen approach as to develop the overall hybrid stepping stone detection method. The study shows that by applying the hybrid concept in stepping stone detection, benefits can be gained from the less number of false positive and false negative rates, robust against active perturbation and the overall stepping stone methods becomes more precise.

AB  - With the rapid development of information technology, computer and networking, it has brought convenience to the whole world, it has changed the way we live our daily life, interactions with people are no longer just face to face, but can be transmitted through the use of internet. With the frequent use of internet technology, Cyber crime became the new threat of our society. Amongst all advance technology, wireless network is the number one threat, with high mobility, no wired required and easy installation, it's the most common way to access the internet these days. Wireless signals travels through air rather than a traditional wired network which can be much more vulnerable for those who has intentions pursuing illegal activities. With the increases growth of internet users and the development of new technologies, current legislations and security has faced difficulties in trying to keep up, hence Cyber crime numbers are increased rapidly. Although wireless Cyber crime is a new threat, but with the detail tracking and investigation effort, ultimately the professional will find some kind of digital evidence, and its often required to identify and preserve in order to be recognized and restoring the truth, hence the establishment of trainings in digital evidence through to forensic requires immediate implementation, with increase of the standards and knowledge it will strength the competence and credibility of the forensics unit's professional ability in assistance to fight again all crime.

AB  - In a distributed multi-user environment, the security policy must not only specify legitimate user privileges but also aid in the detection of the abuse of the privileges and adapt to perceived system threat conditions. This paper advocates extending authorization policy evaluation mechanisms with a means for generating audit data allowing immediate notification of suspicious application level activity. It additionally suggests that the evaluation of the policies themselves adapt to perceived network threat conditions, possibly affected by the receipt of such audit data by other processes. Such advanced policies assist in detecting and responding to intrusion and misuse and they allow more efficient utilization of security services, such as authentication, audit, and notification. We present an authorization framework, which enables the representation and enforcement of advanced security policies. Our approach is based on expanding the policy evaluation mechanism with the ability to generate real time actions, such as checking the current system threat level and sending a notification.

AB  - Remote voting through the Internet provides convenience and access to the electorate. At the same time, the security concerns facing any distributed application are magnified when the task is so crucial to democratic society. In addition, some of the electoral process loses transparency when it is encapsulated in information technology. In this paper, we examine the public record of three recent elections that used Internet voting. Our specific goal is to identify any potential flaws that security experts would recognize, but that may have not been identified in the rush to implement technology. To do this, we present a multiple exploratory case study, looking at elections conducted between 2006 and 2007 in Estonia, The Netherlands, and Switzerland. These elections were selected as particularly interesting and accessible, and each presents its own technical and security challenges. The electoral environment, technical design, and process for each election are described, including reconstruction of details which are implied but not specified within the source material. We found that all three elections warrant significant concern about voter security, verifiability, and transparency. Usability, our fourth area of focus, seems to have been well-addressed in these elections. While our analysis is based on public documents and previously published reports, therefore lacking access to any confidential materials held by electoral officials, this comparative analysis provides interesting insight and consistent questions across all these cases. Effective review of Internet voting requires an aggressive stance towards identifying potential security and operational flaws, and we encourage the use of third-party reviews with critical technology skills during design, programming, and voting to reduce the changes of failure or fraud that would undermine public confidence.

AB  - In regulated domains such as finance and health care, failure to comply with regulation can lead to financial, civil and criminal penalties. While systems vary from organization to organization, the same regulations apply for all systems. As a result, efficiencies could be gained if the commonalities between systems could be captured in public, shared, test suites for regulations. We propose the use of Behavior-Driven-Development (BDD) technology to create these test suites. With BDD, desired system behavior with respect to regulatory requirements can be captured as constrained natural language 'scenarios'. The scenarios can then be automated through system-specific test drivers. The goal of this research is to enable organizations to compare their systems to regulation in a repeatable and traceable way through the use of BDD. To evaluate our approach, we developed seven scenarios based on the HITECH Act Meaningful Use (MU) regulations for healthcare. We then created system-specific code for three open-source electronic health record systems. We found that it was possible to create scenarios and system-specific code supporting scenario execution on three systems, that iTrust can be shown to be noncompliant, and that emergency access procedures are not defined clearly enough by the regulation to determine compliance or non-compliance.

This paper presents a brief overview of the traceback problem, while discussing the features of software, network and computer forensics. In the rest of this paper, various traceback mechanisms are examined while categorized according to their features and modes of operation. Finally, we propose a classification schema for all traceback methods in order to assess and combine their benefits so as to provide enough information for digital forensics analyses, thus getting -the right way- one step closer to the actual attacker.

AB  - 802.11-based wireless networking has significantly altered the networking means and topology for cities, offices, homes and coffee shops over the last five years. A second generation of wireless devices has extended what was once a computer-to-computer protocol into the area of embedded functional devices. Accompanying this widespread usage is the presence of crime; the more popular technology, the more opportunity exists for its misuse. This work studies the 802.11-based wireless networking environment from a forensic computing perspective. It seeks to understand the current state of wireless misuse: present misuses; potential forms of misuse involving 802.11-based wireless networks; and current tools and techniques used in its identification, containment and analysis. The research highlights the lack of current tools and procedures for forensic computing investigations that are able to effectively handle the presence of wireless devices and networks, and that there are forms of misuse that may escape detection by forensic investigation teams.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a secure distributed file system using hysteresis signatures. Although tremendous amounts of information are stored on file servers, it is impractical to have a professional and reliable person to manage such information, especially for small organizations. Also, setting up RAID or multiple servers for the purpose of fault tolerance is a difficult and time-consuming task. We introduced a distributed secure file system in a previous work. However, since the proposed file system was problematic from the viewpoint of computer forensics,we propose here a new method using hysteresis signatures. The confidentiality of information of files is maintained since files are encrypted and distributed among the PCs of the users. Operation logs are securely saved on the system, and log is chained one by one. Moreover, the logs are exchanged by several PCs and users in order to make the system safer than the existing one.

AB  - In most of the current authorization frameworks in applications systems, the authorization for a user operation is determined using a static database like ACL entries or system tables. These frameworks cannot provide the foundation for supporting multiple types of authorizations like emergency authorizations, context-based authorizations etc., which are required in many vertical market systems like healthcare application systems. We describe a dynamic authorization framework which supports multiple authorization types. We use the acronym DAFMAT (Dynamic Authorization Framework for Multiple Authorization Types) to refer to this framework. The DAFMAT framework uses a combination of role-based access control (RBAC) and dynamic type enforcement (DTE) augmented with a logic-driven authorization engine. The application of DAFMAT for evaluating and determining various types of authorization requests for the Admissions Discharge and Transfer System (ADT) in a healthcare enterprise is described.

This paper discusses IAM component of Security as a Service (SecaaS) in the context of cloud computing with a Trust Agent. We have proposed user-centric trust agent identity service which is aimed to create trust among the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) in the federated environment. Relevant standards such as SAML, SPML, XACML, and OAuth are discussed to enable trusted and secure access to cloud services.

AB  - One of the most strategic component for an efficient and effective emergency management is the availability of an infrastructure on support of information sharing. Indeed, during emergency situations it is vital that the necessary information timely reaches the right person. Even if emergency management usually requires to bypass access control policies in place during the system normal operations, it is crucial that such process is temporary and controlled by proper emergency policies. To cope with these requirements, in this paper we present a system able to: 1) detect the events that cause the triggering of an emergency policy, 2) make immediately available to the authorized subjects information covered by the emergency policy. This is achieved by the definition of flexible emergency policies and by the use of a Complex Event Processing system on support of event monitoring and policy triggering. The paper also presents preliminary experiments on system overhead.

Using some forensic tools, forensic examiners can investigate values of windows registry and get information can be forensic evidences. However, since windows registry contains huge amount of values and these values can be modified by users, suspect can hide his secret like password in registry values. In this paper, we discuss the basics of Windows XP registry and extract some registry entries related to forensic analysis. Finally, we show that some countermeasures are needed, listing up consideration items for hiding secrets in registry as suspect's viewpoint.

AB  - The growth of the Internet has been accompanied by the growth of e-services (e.g. e-commerce, e-health). This proliferation of e-services and the increasing regulatory and legal requirements for personal privacy have fueled the need to protect the personal privacy of e-service users. Approaches are needed to ensure that providers of e-services comply with the privacy policies of service users. In this paper, we examine privacy legislation to derive requirements for privacy policy compliance systems. We then propose an agent-based architecture for a privacy policy compliance system that satisfies many of the requirements and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed architecture.

AB  - The Sarbanes-Oxley Act instituted a series of corporate reforms to improve the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting. Sections 302 and 404 of the Act require SEC-reporting companies to implement internal controls over financial reporting, periodically assess the effectiveness of these internal controls, and certify the accuracy of their financial statements. We suggest that database technology can play an important role in assisting compliance with the internal control provisions of the Act. The core components of our solution include: (i) modeling of required workflows, (ii) active enforcement of control activities, (iii) auditing of actual workflows to verify compliance with internal controls, and (iv) discovery-driven OLAP to identify irregularities in financial data. We illustrate how the features of our solution fulfill Sarbanes-Oxley requirements using several real-life scenarios. In the process, we identify opportunities for new database research.

AB  - The goal of service provider federations is to support a controlled method by which distributed organizations can provide services to qualified individuals and manage their identity attributes at an inter-organizational level. In order to make access control decisions the history of activities should be accounted for, therefore it is necessary to record information on interactions among the federation entities. To achieve these goals we propose a comprehensive assertion language able to support description of static and dynamic properties of the federation system. The assertions are a powerful means to describe the behavior of the entities interacting in the federation, and to define policies controlling access to services and privacy policies. We also propose a log-based approach for capturing the history of activities within the federation implemented as a set of tables stored at databases at the various organizations in the federation. We illustrate how, by using different types of queries on such tables, security properties of the federation can be verified

AB  - Security in today's government and commercial environments is changing. The willingness to provide manpower against security threats is diminishing. Risk management is preferred to risk avoidance. In order for management to ensure that the appropriate security is provided while downsizing or right sizing protective services and other security personnel, automation of security technologies is a necessity. Several manpower intensive tasks and processes are: facilities access control, issuance of staff and visitor badges, provision of information for visitors, access control to interior facilities, and the issuance of office keys. Reduction of the required manning for these processes is enabled though the automation and integration of various security technologies including biometric identification systems. This paper provides a background on manpower intensive tasks and processes, security technologies that may be employed within them, resource reduction capabilities, and a customer's experience with the use of the technologies within a large Government environment

AB  - A law now in effect in the United States requires protection of individual privacy in computerized personal information record-keeping systems maintained by the federal government. Similar laws apply in certain state and local governments. Legislation has also been introduced to extend the requirements for privacy protection to the private sphere. Central in privacy protection are the rights of an individual to know what data are maintained on him, challenge their veracity and relevance, limit their nonroutine use or dissemination, and be assured that their quality, integrity, and confidentiality are maintained. In all computer systems that maintain and process valuable information, or provide services to multiple users concurrently, it is necessary to provide security safeguards against unauthorized access, use, or modifications of any data file. This difficult problem has not yet been solved in the general case. Computer systems must also be protected against unauthorized use, disruption of operations, and physical damage. The growing number of computer applications involving valuable information or assets plus the growing number of criminal actions directed against computer applications and systems or perpetrated by using computers underscore the need for finding effective solutions to the computer security problem. In the future, concerns for privacy and security must become integral in the planning and design of computer systems and their applications.

AB  - This paper presents an approach to assess security of Web servers. This method can be used to compare the security features of different Web servers installations and to determine how secure a given Web server configuration is. The assessment is done by applying a set of tests designed to check if the system under evaluation fulfils a set of security practices defined by an extensive field study. This work targets the most typical issues related to Web servers ranging from classic Web servers misconfiguration to the absence of a secure network infrastructure and of well-defined security policies to respond to security incidents. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated through the security assessment and comparison of five different real Web servers.

AB  - Clinics in developing nations often use paper-based records that are hard to manage or are inefficient. Electronic medical records (EMR) systems could help increase the efficiency and efficacy of these clinics. Even though some EMR systems have been developed for developing countries, they lack customizability. This paper gives some background information about EMR systems: how they are used in developed countries, and how FileMaker, an off-the-shelf database software, could be used to rapidly deploy EMR systems in clinics and hospitals of developing countries. An existing EMR database developed by Banner Alzheimer's Institute serves as a proof of concept that FileMaker is a viable EMR solution.

AB  - Trusted Mach (TMach) is a message-passing, server-oriented system being targeted at the B3 level of the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC). The authors present a rationale for why these characteristics, and the TMach architecture that implements and embodies them, are compatible with B3 requirements. It is shown that the TMach TCB (trusted computer base), composed of a kernel (which implements basic system abstractions and mediates their access) and a collection of trusted servers, is structured to provide conceptually simple protection mechanisms. Least privilege and modularity are central to the server-oriented design of the system. Easy extensibility of the TMach TCB to provide trusted applications is an added benefit of the system structure

AB  - Digital forensics encompasses the process of identifying the perpetrator and the criminal method by analyzing the logs generated in the computer. Log files record the activities of the computer and by reading them one can know what kind of event happened at a certain time. Therefore, secure logs with the integrity property are essential. In this paper, we discuss two approaches to achieve the integrity of logs- the kernel module and virtualization, and compare them. Although virtualization is more inefficient in performance than the kernel module, it provides more security properties for logs. Thus, we then focus on the virtualization approach with a detailed proposal, which describes ways to preserve logs without tampering and deletion.

AB  - Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) received much attention from academia and industry lately. However, scant research information on evaluation frameworks regarding PETs is available. Recent developments delineate between different Pets based on high-level principles and privacy concerns. The goal of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we present a framework for evaluating Pets in general based on acknowledged positive characteristics of Pets sourced from literature. Secondly, we use this framework to demonstrate how different PETs can be evaluated and benchmarked against each other. We performed an experimental evaluation of our recently proposed Hippocratic Privacy Protection (HPP) framework, benchmarking it against other well-published PETs including Hippocratic databases, PRIME/Prime Life and Encore to demonstrate the applicability of the evaluation framework. The main contribution of the paper is the provisioning of a PET evaluation framework based on a number of PET evaluation criteria and features to determine its efficacy in giving individuals control over their personal information. We then outline several future research directions.

AB  - As the Internet has matured, so have the threats to its safe use, and so must the security measures that enable its business use. Traditional piecemeal, single-layer, single-dimensional security approaches are no longer adequate. These approaches can create a false sense of security and create as many problems as they attempt to address. We propose a multifaceted framework to prevent, detect, and respond to ever more sophisticated threats to enterprise IT information and assets. We outline a practical implementation approach to building enterprise IT security mechanisms in an incremental and continuous fashion. We believe that enterprises should adopt a similar multifaceted framework, following a practical but disciplined implementation approach. Enterprises must treat IT security as a required business enabler rather than just a costly item with low priority

The nature of cyber threats in general - and advanced persistent threats in particular - requires a longer-term commitment from senior leadership, including vision, strategy, and investment prioritization as well as the organizational agility to respond to ever-changing tactics and techniques. The cyber preparedness (Cyber Prep) methodology enables an organization to (1) characterize the cyber threats that an organization or mission faces; (2) determine the level of preparedness necessary to ensure mission success; (3) facilitate strategic planning for cyber security by setting preparedness objectives; and (4) establish priorities for cyber security investment planning and management decisions. This paper presents the framework underlying the Cyber Prep methodology.

AB  - Imagine that you're building a software system that collects healthcare data and financial information from its users. It might seem obvious that this personal information should be protected from prying eyes through access control mechanisms, audit trails, transaction controls, transmission encryption, and so on--in fact, perhaps so obvious that in many cases people perform only a cursory security analysis and produce rather generic security requirements. But is this the right way to build secure software? Are security requirements so similar across projects that we simply don't need to invest the time to explore product-level needs or to document requirements at an individual level for each project? The Web extra at http://youtu.be/qoocRI-7yRQ is an audio podcast in which author Jane Cleland-Huang discusses the importance of making informed decisions about how much time and effort to invest in analyzing security needs and specifying product-level security requirements.

AB  - Modern e-Health systems require advanced computing and storage capabilities, leading to the adoption of technologies like the grid and giving birth to novel health grid systems. In particular, intensive care medicine uses this paradigm when facing a high flow of data coming from intensive care unit's (ICU) inpatients just like demonstrated by the ICGrid system prototyped by the University of Cyprus. Unfortunately, moving an ICU patient's data from the traditionally isolated hospital's computing facilities to data grids via public networks (i.e., the Internet) makes it imperative to establish an integral and standardized security solution to avoid common attacks on the data and metadata being managed. Particular emphasis must be put on the patient's personal data, the protection of which is required by legislations in many countries of the European Union and the world in general. In this paper, we extend our previous research with the following contributions: 1) a mandatory access control model to protect patient's metadata; 2) a major security revision to our previously proposed privacy protocol by contributing with a &#x201C;quality of security&#x201D; quantitative metric to improve fragmented data's assurance; and finally, 3) a set of early results to demonstrate that our protocol not only improves a patient personal data's security and privacy but also achieves a performance comparable with existing approaches.

However, the retention of communication data increases the security threats against the privacy of theirs subscribers. In this paper we explore the privacy issues of data retention in Internet communications. We also describe possible security mechanisms which may thwart these threats and minimize the risks against user privacy.

AB  - The advent of cloud computing allows the provision of several commodities "as-a-service". For enterprise systems, a particularly interesting business model is the offer of configurable business processes for different consumers, which can then outsource their execution onto the cloud. Although such an outsourcing harbors a vast economic potential, both external and internal auditing pose a general challenge for their acceptance. This paper reviews the role of remote auditing as a means to address this issue and indicates research directions for automated tool support.

AB  - Third-generation (3G) mobile phones are capable of high data rate Internet connection and promise seamless connectivity for a free roaming user. They can provide an "always on" Internet, and make a range of services, traditionally available on desktop computers, accessible to mobile users, irrespective of their location. Providing adequate security for these phones and the services that they offer is a central concern for their acceptability and uptake. We briefly review the security of second generation mobile phones and then discuss security architecture proposed for 3G phones. The new security issues that are of importance because of the combination of their advanced capabilities and limitations are discussed.

AB  - eXpert-BSM is a real time forward-reasoning expert system that analyzes Sun Solaris audit trails. Based on many years of intrusion detection research, eXpert-BSM's knowledge base detects a wide range of specific and general forms of misuse, provides detailed reports and recommendations to the system operator, and has a low false-alarm rate. Host-based intrusion detection offers the ability to detect misuse and subversion through the direct monitoring of processes inside the host, providing an important complement to network-based surveillance. Suites of eXpert-BSMs may be deployed throughout a network, and their alarms managed, correlated, and acted on by remote or local subscribing security services, thus helping to address issues of decentralized management. Inside the host, eXpert-BSM is intended to operate as a true security daemon for host systems, consuming few CPU cycles and very little memory and secondary storage. eXpert-BSM has been available for download on the Internet since April 2000, and has been successfully deployed in several production environments.

AB  - Issues arising from the application of the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) to networks are discussed, particularly those requiring further research. The focus is on how to integrate many of the concepts in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) security addendum into the framework of the TCSEC. The discussion covers the protocol architectural issues of the trusted network with particular emphasis on the relationship among network protocols, protocol reference model, and network security. It is argued that application of the TCSEC to computer networks requires incorporation of a network protocol reference model as implemented in a protocol suite.

AB  - In regulated domains such as finance and health care, failure to comply with regulation can lead to financial, civil and criminal penalties. While systems vary from organization to organization, regulations apply across organizations. We propose the use of Behavior-Driven-Development (BDD) scenarios as the basis of an automated compliance test suite for standards such as regulation and interoperability. Such test suites could become a shared asset for use by all systems subject to these regulations and standards. Each system, then, need only create their own system-specific test driver code to automate their compliance checks. The goal of this research is to enable organizations to compare their systems to regulation in a repeatable and traceable way through the use of BDD. To evaluate our proposal, we developed an abbreviated HIPAA test suite and applied it to three open-source electronic health record systems. The scenarios covered all security behavior defined by the selected regulation. The system-specific test driver code covered all security behavior defined in the scenarios, and identified where the tested system lacked such behavior.

AB  - Many business processes require documents and transactions with trusted signatures. This has been a key issue that blocks enterprises from transforming paper-based business processes into e-business processes. Digital signature and PKI technology make it possible that documents and transactions with the need for signatures can be electronically signed and processed. We describe in this paper the design and implementation of an enterprise portal for secure document management. The portal is a Web-based management system that can be used to, at the enterprise level, streamline document-based business and personal transactions, and securely maintain e-documents in the centralized database. To automate and secure the process of document-based transactions, e.g., filing travel expense reports, the system integrated digital signature and PKI technology for digitally signing and managing documents and forms. Compared to other systems, it is open to various types of user authentication mechanisms, it supports the signing and verification of most document formats, and it provides a Web service endpoint for application integration, aggregation, and automation.

AB  - In the past few years, web-based applications and their data management needs have changed dramatically. Relational databases are often being replaced by other viable alternatives, such as NoSQL databases, for reasons of scalability and heterogeneity. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is an agile database built for scalability, performance and high availability. It can be deployed in single server environment and also on complex multi-site architectures. MongoDB provides high performance for read and write operations by leveraging in-memory computing. Although researchers have motivated the need for MongoDB, not much appears in the area of log management. Efficient log management techniques are needed for various reasons including security, accountability, and improving the performance of the system. Towards this end, we analyze the different logging methods offered by MongoDB and compare them to the NIST standard. Our analysis indicates that profiling and mongosniff are useful for log management and we present a simple model that combines the two techniques.

AB  - The Linux operating system has been used as a server system in plenty of business services worldwide. Nowadays, a lot of incident response approaches on such kind of platform have been established by many researchers active in the computer forensic discipline. Interestingly, many frameworks about how to deal with a live digital investigation on a Linux systems have been illustrated in the forensic literature. Conversely, as a matter of fact, there are not so many tools for approaching live forensic of a Linux system. Thus, we have developed and implemented a new framework to deal with a compromised Linux system in a digital forensic investigation. The resulting framework has been called LECT (Linux Evidence Collection Tool) ant aims to represent a significant contribution in the field of live forensic analysis of Linux based systems.
