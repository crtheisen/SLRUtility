AB  - Forensic analysis of software log files is used to extract user behavior profiles, detect fraud, and check compliance with policies and regulations. Software systems maintain several types of log files for different purposes. For example, a system may maintain logs for debugging, monitoring application performance, and/or tracking user access to system resources. The objective of my research is to develop and validate a minimum set of log file attributes and software security metrics for user nonrepudiation by measuring the degree to which a given audit log file captures the data necessary to allow for meaningful forensic analysis of user behavior within the software system. For a log to enable user nonrepudiation, the log file must record certain data fields, such as a unique user identifier. The log must also record relevant user activity, such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting system resources, as well as software security events, such as the addition or revocation of user privileges. Using a grounded theory method, I propose a methodology for observing the current state of activity logging mechanisms in healthcare, education, and finance, then I quantify differences between activity logs and logs not specifically intended to capture user activity. I will then propose software security metrics for quantifying the forensic-ability of log files. I will evaluate my work with empirical analysis by comparing the performance of my metrics on several types of log files, including both activity logs and logs not directly intended to record user activity. My research will help software developers strengthen user activity logs for facilitating forensic analysis for user nonrepudiation.

AB  - Unified enterprise application security is a newly emerging approach for providing protection against application level attacks. Conventional application security approaches that embed security into each critical application results into scattered security mechanism, which is not only difficult to manage but also creates security loopholes. Therefore, new unified enterprise application security concept is evolving in the industry that consists of centralized authentication, access control, incident response and auditing. Industries such as Computer Associate, Cerebit, Entrust, Evidian, IBM Tivoli, Netegrity, Ohlix and SunOne have comes up with the identity and access management solutions that are based on this concept. Significant amount of misunderstanding exists in the industry and research community about appropriate features of such a unified product. Therefore we have proposed new enterprise application security (EAS) comparison framework to compare existing enterprise application security products. This framework helps an enterprise in selecting appropriate application security product. From comparison we found that Computer Associate and Netegrity solutions are the best available solutions, however none of the current available solutions are providing complete enterprise application security. Therefore we have proposed new unified enterprise application security architecture. This architecture provides all basic information security and other critical services such as, auditing, reporting, authentication, access control, confidentiality, integrity, commitment to standards, incident response, scalability. flexibility, manageability, and compliance of regulatory mandates.

AB  - Securely maintaining log records over extended periods of time is very important to the proper functioning of any organization. Integrity of the log files and that of the logging process need to be ensured at all times. In addition, as log files often contain sensitive information, confidentiality and privacy of log records are equally important. However, deploying a secure logging infrastructure involves substantial capital expenses that many organizations may find overwhelming. Delegating log management to the cloud appears to be a viable cost saving measure. In this paper, we identify the challenges for a secure cloud-based log management service and propose a framework for doing the same.

AB  - In order to provide accountability, a better logging system is needed so that not only the activities but also their relationships are captured. To this end, our previous work proposed a novel logging mechanism, flow-net methodology, for accountability. In this paper, we extend the flow-net methodology and present its design and implementation in wireless networks. We also evaluate the performance of flow-net and compare it to that of audit log files.

The management of authentication, authorization, and accountability in these applications is therefore a very important and difficult problem to solve. In this article, we describe how audit logging can be built into the Web services infrastructure.

AB  - With the widespread use of information, variety of security logs have increased greatly, which due need for security log management. Organizations requirements have imposed to collect, store, and analyze tremendous volumes of log data across entire infrastructure for extended durations and at increasingly granular levels. It is the process of generating, transmitting, storing, analyzing, and disposing security log data from network to databases. Due to the wide variety of logs, storing comprises different methods. Recorded events in collection module are processed, normalized and classified. Logs are stored in storage module in order to use in forensic, reviewing, auditing and providing further necessities of correlation module. Routine log correlation analysis is beneficial for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activities, troubleshooting and operational network problems. So log management is an important and efficient activity in network monitoring. Finding an effective log management functional architecture for network events analysis is the main goal of this paper. In this paper, we aim to suggest log management architecture with more common functions that are used by vendors. By studying logging architectures the main functions are administration of log collection, normalizing, categorization, queuing prioritizing and storing logged events/alarms by sensors. Log functions are different but the suitable architecture must justify the functions to send a normative, synchronized and prioritized log in an efficient way. The mentioned functions are gathered from SIEM products characteristics. Suggested architecture includes functions and activities in log collection server and storage server.

AB  - Unified Enterprise application security is a new emerging approach for providing protection against application level attacks. Conventional application security approach that consists of embedding security into each critical application leads towards scattered security mechanism that is not only difficult to manage but also creates security loopholes. According to the CSI/FBI computer crime survey report, almost 80% of the security breaches come from authorized users. In this paper, we have worked on the concept of unified security model, which manages all security aspect from a single security window. The basic idea is to keep business functionality separate from security components of the application. Our main focus was on the designing of frame work for unified layer which supports single point of policy control, centralize logging mechanism, granular, context aware access control, and independent from any underlying authentication technology and authorization policy.

AB  - Modern mobile devices are able to run a wide range of thirdparty/service provider applications that provide users with a variety of attractive services. These applications have their own databases on the mobile device; user data pertaining to the application are stored there. The popularity comes with a price: attackers are interested in exploiting the weaknesses of the mobile systems to manipulate personal information of users via malicious code or malware. Another problem is that mobile devices are often stolen or misplaced and stored data, which users value more than the hardware, compromised. We propose a consolidated logging scheme that reflects all transactions performed on all databases of mobile applications. Only a part of this logis stored on the mobile device, thus addressing the conflict between space limitation in these devices and the space requirement of logging; yet, it is tamper-resistant and enables restoration of data through logging. We formalize our claims and explain how our scheme addresses some important problems created by malware and theft.

AB  - Nowadays, computer crime is becoming more and more prevalent. It has the characteristic of high technology, hard to be found and rapid spreading. It brings challenges to computer forensics. Computer forensics focuses on collecting and analyzing various evidences for these crimes. It is far different from the traditional forensics, and becoming more and more hot in enterprise and academic. This paper describes the current state as well as future trends in the research of computer forensics, and illustrates the support mechanism for computer forensics in Linux as a typical platform of widely used software system.

AB  - Value of software log file analysis has been constantly increasing with the value of information to organizations. Log management tools still have a lot to deliver in order to empower their customers with the true strength of log information. In addition to the traditional uses such as testing software functional conformance, troubleshooting and performance benchmarking, log analysis has proven its capabilities in fields like intrusion detection and compliance evaluation. This is verified by the emphasis on log analysis in regulations like PCI DSS, FISMA, HIPAA and frameworks such as ISO 27001 and COBIT. In this paper we present an in depth analysis into current log analysis domains and common problems. A practical guide to the use of few popular log analysis tools is also included. Lack of proper support for structured analysis is identified as one major flaw in existing tools. After that, we describe a framework we developed for structured log analysis with the view of providing a solution to open problems in the domain. The core strength of the framework is its ability to handle many log file formats that are not well served by existing tools and providing sophisticated infrastructure for automating recurring log analysis procedures. We prove the usefulness of the framework with a simple experiment.

AB  - Information restriction controls access and renders records immutable, information accountability requires data transparency to easily and efficiently determine when a particular use is appropriate. Information accountability in the context of relational databases is associated with time in a surprising number of ways, as is summarized in this paper. Notarization and validation of a database exploit the temporal semantics of a transaction-time database. A corruption can be associated with multiple times. Forensic analysis determines the when: bounds on the corruption time, and the where: also specified in terms of time. These bounds are depicted in a two-dimensional corruption diagram, with both axes denoting time. The various kinds of corruption events are defined in terms of time. A parameter termed the regret interval has significant security and performance implications. This paper emphasizes the deep connections between time and the definition, detection, forensic analysis, and characterized extent of a database corruption within the context of information accountability.

AB  - IP address of a device, from where an offending activity was performed, is of limited value, because it does not specify a physical device/user, but an endpoint in network. It is useful to have information about where a device/user was at the time the offending activity was performed. It would be desirable to correlate different pieces of evidence to discover information, such as IP addresses used by the same device, physical address and location of the device, connection time of the device, browsing habits and mail access transactions carried out by the user using the device. Log data from various sources are required to be correlated together to create contexts of information, which is not visible from one source alone. In large networks, users/devices accessing a private network repeatedly can be tracked by analyzing and correlating DHCP, Network Access Control, WWW, Email server logs. With huge amount of logs, the common approach of manual browsing, correlating of log events, based on timelines is tedious, unresponsive approach. Flat file based sequential search system is not responsive, hence RDBMS based tracking systems are desirable. To build a responsive system requires identifying, consolidating log files, conversion, transmission and storage into relational databases. An automated system has been developed at our organization for forensic analysis of network accesses, with device and user tracking as its goal. We present, our approach to perform log management, correlation, which assists in performing responsive forensic analysis of real network with more than 2500 nodes, aimed at tracking users/devices.

AB  - Computer forensics investigations are based on the evidence search process to determine the intruder techniques and activities. Current tools are mainly focused in gathering evidence from the target system however its analysis is a highly complicated task. In this paper, we present an Automated Forensic Diagnosis System composed by a Knowledge Attack Base and a series of log analysis processes working all together to reconstruct the attack actions after a security incident occurred. The log analysis is carried out by an Event Correlation Module which helps detecting multi-step attacks as well as reducing the false positive rate. The goal is to assist the forensic investigator reducing the time and complexity of the process.

AB  - Today's growing number of security threats to computers and networks also increase the importance of log inspections to support the detection of possible breaches. The investigation and assessment of security incidents becomes more and more a daily business. Further, the manual log analysis is essentially in the context of developing signatures for intrusion detection systems (IDS), which allow for an automated defense against security attacks or incidents. But the analysis of log data in the context of fo-rensic investigations and IDS signature development is a tedious and time-consuming task, due to the large amount of textual data. Moreover, this task requires a skilled knowledge to differentiate between the important and the non-relevant information. In this paper, we propose an approach for log resp. audit data representation, which aims at simplifying the analysis process for the security officer. For this purpose audit data and existing relations between audit events are represented graphically in a three-dimensional space. We describe a general approach for analyzing and exploring audit or log data in the context of this presentation paradigm. Further, we introduce our tool, which implements this approach and demonstrate the strengths and benefits of this presentation and exploration form.

AB  - Establishing contractual liabilities in case of litigation is generally a delicate matter. It becomes even more challenging when IT systems are involved. At the core of the problem lies the issue of the evidence provided by the opposing parties. We believe that the means to constitute evidence that could be used in case of conflict should be considered from the onset of IT projects and be part of the requirements for the design of IT systems. This paper proposes criteria for acceptable log architectures depending on the features of the system and the potential claims between the parties. We establish properties guaranteed by acceptable architectures and illustrate our framework with a travel booking system.

AB  - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) is an emerging application for industrial automation. It is being widely used in critical infrastructure for monitoring and controlling the activities. The collaborative environment and interconnectivity of SCADA system needs communications and transmission of sensed real time data like status of machines, breaks and leakages in the system across various devices in the industrial plant. Such real time data provoke security breaches to SCADA systems and results in compromise of availability, integrity, confidentiality and trust relationship between the devices of SCADA systems. As the numbers of deliberate cyber attacks on these systems are increasing, providing a scheme to identify malicious activities and defend the attacks; thereby create secure environment for SCADA systems is an essential task. By considering constraints and efficiency requirements for such networks, we are proposing a scheme that uses Log to identify some malicious activities through continuous monitoring. In Log, we have only prioritized some parameters that help us to detect some vulnerable activities and at node level by using cooperative monitoring the nodes itself takes care of some attacks. In this new approach Log analysis for the identification of malicious activities is made using cluster based architecture. This work also considers the constraints of the SCADA system thereby providing an elegant identification of malicious activities for the current SCADA system.

AB  - Windows registry, a central repository for configuration data, should be investigated for obtaining forensic evidences, since it contains lots of information that are of potential evidential value. Using some forensic tools, forensic examiners can investigate values of windows registry and get information can be forensic evidences. However, since windows registry contains huge amount of values and these values can be modified by users, suspect can hide his secret like password in registry values. In this paper, we discuss the basics of Windows XP registry and extract some registry entries related to forensic analysis. Finally, we show that some countermeasures are needed, listing up consideration items for hiding secrets in registry as suspect's viewpoint.

AB  - In most of companies or organizations, logs play important role in information security. However, the common security mechanism only backup logs, it is not able to find out traces of intruders because the hacker who is able to intrudes the security mechanism of organization would try to alter logs or destroy important intrusion evidences making it impossible to preserve evidence using traditional log security strategies. Thus, logs are not considered as evidence to prove the damage. In that case, digital evidence lacks in terms of completeness which makes it difficult to perform computer forensics operations. In order to maintain the completeness and reliability of evidence for later forensic procedures and intrusion detection, the study applies concepts of steganography to logs forensics, for which even intrusion altered records will be kept as well. Comparing to traditional security strategies, this study proposes a better logging mechanism to ensure the completeness of logs. Furthermore, the study will assist in intrusion detection through alteration behavior, and help in forensic operations.

AB  - Log event correlation is an effective means of detecting system faults and security breaches encountered in information technology environments. Centralized, database-driven log event correlation is common, but suffers from flaws such as high network bandwidth utilization, significant requirements for system resources, and difficulty in detecting certain suspicious behaviors. Distributed event correlation is often assumed to be superior, but no research effort has been made which quantitatively evaluates its advantages and disadvantages. This research presents a distributed event correlation system which performs security event detection, and evaluates it experimentally, compared with a centralized alternative. The comparison measures the value in distributed event correlation by considering network bandwidth utilization, detection capability and database query efficiency. The implementation of these advantages allows a 99% reduction of network syslog traffic in the low accountability case. In addition, the system detects every implemented malicious use case, with a low false positive rate.

AB  - Computer logs represent a valuable source of monitoring information being typically the only mechanism for gaining visibility into the behavior of monitored resources. However, even in modern cloud data centers the majority of logs is produced in an unstructured data format with free-form natural language messages carrying the most important portion of the information. This is source of many issues that prevent logs from being effectively and intelligently processed in an automated way. We argue that it is an essential flaw when considering the volume and heterogeneity of logging data produced by cloud. This paper elaborates on the common problems and shortcomings in the domain of (application) logging, and presents an experimental logging mechanism for Java language that is capable of producing logs in a unified and extensible format allowing for their efficient automated processing.

AB  - To investigate the exploitation and contamination by self-propagating Internet worms, a provenance-aware tracing mechanism is highly desirable. Provenance unawareness causes difficulties in fast, accurate identification of a worm&#146;s break-in point, and incurs significant log inspection overhead. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of process coloring, an efficient provenance-aware approach to worm break-in and contamination tracing. More specifically, process coloring assigns a "color", a unique system-wide identifier, to each remotely-accessible server or process. The color will then be either inherited by spawned child processes or diffused indirectly through process actions (e.g., read/write operations). Process coloring brings two major advantages: (1) It enables fast color-based identification of a worm&#146;s break-in point even before detailed log analysis; (2) It naturally partitions log data based on their colors, effectively reducing the volume of log data that need to be examined for worm investigation. A tamper-resistant log collection method is developed based on the virtual machine introspection technique. Our experiments with a number of real-world worms demonstrate the advantages of processing coloring.

It automatically generates rules from historical data and, in terms of those rules, identifies computer transactions that are at variance with historically established usage patterns. Issues addressed include how W&amp;S generates rules from a necessarily small sample of all possible transactions, how W&amp;S deals with inherently categorical data, and how W&amp;S assists system security officers in their review of audit logs. Preliminary results with W&amp;S show that the software does periodically detect anomalies of high interest even in data though to be free of such events

AB  - The rise of many kinds of grid systems, and associated security threats, makes very necessary the provision of trustworthy services for audit and logging. However, existing solutions tend to put little emphasis on the security of logging. We present a number of use cases where the logs have security properties in their own rights, and so the logs themselves are highly privileged: hence, these need to be integrity and confidentiality protected while being generated, accessed, reconciled and analysed with distributed services spanning across multiple administrative domains. We derive a common set of secure logging requirements to address the security gaps which exist between these use cases and existing solutions.From the requirements, we propose a novel logging architecture for the grid based on virtual machine (VM) isolation and trusted computing capabilities: a small number of privileged driver VMs trigger all trusted logging requests and forward them to the secure logging service running within the log security manager. The logging service verifies the integrity of the log data and the security configurations of these driver VMs (log generators) before storing the logs.

AB  - Traditional access control mechanisms prevent illegal access by controlling access right before executing an action; they belong to a class of a priori security solutions and, from this point of view, they have some limitations, like inflexibility in unanticipated circumstances. By contrast, a posteriori mechanisms enforce policies not by preventing unauthorized access, but rather by deterring it. Such access control needs evidence to prove violations. Evidence is derived from one or several log records, which trace each user's actions. Efficiency of violation detection mostly depends on the compliance of log records with the access control policy. In order to develop an efficient method for finding these violations, we propose restructuring log records according to a security policy model. We illustrate our methodology by applying it to the healthcare domain, taking care of the IHE (Integrating the healthcare enterprise) framework, particularly its basic security profile, ATNA (Audit Trail and Node Authentication). This profile defines log records established on the analysis of common health practice scenarios. We analyze and establish how ATNA log records can be refined in order to be integrated into an a posteriori access and usage control process, based on an expressive and contextual security policy like the OrBAC policy.

While the security of the embedded devices during the operation of the system is naturally the focus of security considerations, the security of the engineering framework is often overlooked. In this paper, we model the trust boundaries of a typical engineering tool used in an IACS, identify security risks in this context, suggest mitigation techniques for end users, and finally propose an architecture that allows to implement secure engineering frameworks.

AB  - Logs are the files which contain the information about all the events occurring on the system. Logs have been playing a vital role in providing all kinds of information which can be used for several purposes like detecting a suspicious behaviour over the system. The aim of this paper is to study, analyse and generate results by observing host. Log files consist of different header information which can be further used to determine if any kind of malicious activity is discovered then that activity can be traced and blocked.

AB  - In order to overcome the disadvantages of a central authority, a tendency is to move towards a peer-to-peer collaboration where control over data is given to users who can decide with whom they want to share their private data. In this peer-to-peer collaboration it is very difficult to ensure that after data is shared with other peers, these peers will not misbehave and violate data privacy. In this paper, we propose a mechanism that addresses the issue of data privacy violation by auditing the collaboration logs. In our approach, trust values between users are adjusted according to their previous activities on the shared data. Users share their private data by specifying some obligations the receivers are expected to follow. We log modifications done by users as well as the obligations and use a log-auditing mechanism to detect users who misbehaved. We adjust their associated trust values by using any existing decentralized trust model.

AB  - A-priori access control techniques allow granting access to a set of predefined agents. In some processes, we cannot define in advance the set of authorized agents because the characteristics of the process instance determine activity assignment. A-posteriori access control allows access to many agents who claim being authorized. It implements an audit process permitting to check the behavior of the different agents in the system. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a-posteriori access control and we provide an approach allowing modeling an auditable process by using Business Process Management Notation (BPMN). We express audit requirements through text annotations. Finally, we provide an example from the banking context to illustrate an auditable process.

AB  - Sharing data within grid environments always results in losing control over data usage. If the shared information is medical data, this violates laws as specified in HIPAA, because access to such data must be reconstructible and needs to be tightly controlled. To comply with these regulations it must be guaranteed, that each data access and modification is recorded to produce audit trails. The provided solution introduces a new concept for virtual grid computing environments consisting of secure virtual machines, hosting data and indemnifying thorough audit trails by logging every data interaction, solving the problem of traceability and side-access.

AB  - In this paper we present a scheme for building a logging- trail for processes related to eGovernment services. A citizen can reconstruct the trail of such a process and verify its status if he is the subject of that process. Reconstruction is based on hand-overs, special types of log events, that link data stored by multiple logging servers, which are not necessarily trusted. Our scheme is privacy-friendly in the sense that only the authorised subject, i.e. the citizen, can link the different log entries related to one specific process. The scheme is also auditable; it allows logging servers to show that they behave according to a certain policy.

AB  - Trustable log data is essential in digital forensic investigations in order to allow reliable reconstruction of events. Existing solutions do not provide adequate protection, exposing the log-producing application to software-based attacks. In this paper we provide a solution based on Trusted Computing using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and AMD's Secure Virtual Machine technology (SVM). While current solutions only protect against manipulation of existing logs, we go one step further by establishing hardware-based trust in the log producing application. Our solution ensures confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation during creation, storage and transmission of log data.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a lightweight solution for protecting real-time collaborative editing systems against Byzantine faults. We observe that a centralized coordination algorithm not only reduces the complexity of the editing system, it makes easier to harden the system with Byzantine fault tolerance. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the potential threats towards collaborative editing systems and introduce a set of Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms without requiring any additional redundant resources. If the system has sufficient redundancy, such mechanisms can be used to ensure strong protection against various malicious faults. Even without sufficient redundancy in the system, our mechanisms would still help limit the damages caused by a faulty user.

AB  - This paper describes the design of a decision support module (DSM) for an intrusion detection system, which can provide active detection and automated response support during intrusions. The primary function of the decision support module is to provide recommended actions and alternatives and the implications of each recommended action. In the decision support module, the GA (genetic algorithm) was run over a subset of the data, called the training data, and then tested over the entire data set to test real-world performance. The model generated by this GA was based on a new method of data analysis for the intrusion detection problem. Each node in the model's decision tree was designed to hold a randomized coefficient for the data, so that this coefficient multiplied by the data would yield a weight for the certainty of whether a certain record was an attack or not. The coefficients were based on ephemeral random constants (ERC), random numbers generated by the GA specific to mathematical modeling.

AB  - Cloud computing has emerged as a popular computing paradigm in recent years. However, today's cloud computing architectures often lack support for computer forensic investigations. A key task of digital forensics is to prove the presence of a particular file in a given storage system. Unfortunately, it is very hard to do so in a cloud given the black-box nature of clouds and the multi-tenant cloud models. In clouds, analyzing the data from a virtual machine instance or data stored in a cloud storage only allows us to investigate the current content of the cloud storage, but not the previous contents. In this paper, we introduce the idea of building proofs of past data possession in the context of a cloud storage service. We present a scheme for creating such proofs and evaluate its performance in a real cloud provider. We also discuss how this proof of past data possession can be used effectively in cloud forensics.

AB  - Network-based attacks have become common and sophisticated. For this reason, intrusion detection systems are now shifting their focus from the hosts and their operating systems to the network itself. Network intrusion detection is challenging because network auditing produces large amounts of data, and different events related to a single intrusion may be visible in different places in the network. This paper presents network intrusion system, describes the design of a decision support module (DSM) for intrusion detection system, which can provide active detection and automated response support during intrusions. It is designed to be a sense and response system that can monitor various activities on the network. In particular, it simultaneously monitors networked computer's activities at different levels.

AB  - In the dawn of the information age, information has been attributed with an utmost important asset of an organization. There has been manifold rise in the information from past few decades. Information exchange has become the need of business continuity and is required for growth of the organization. Various methods have been introduced for an exchange of information but email has evolved as the prime means of communication for all the organizations. The inherent simplicity of email system has become the prime factor for its popularity. With the increase in information rate, there has been exponential rise in the security threats as well. Email though has inherent simplicity but it has an inherent weak security as well. Email systems are vulnerable to various types of attacks and threats including SMTP - auth attacks, denial of service attacks and also it can act as medium for phishing and pharming attacks. This paper will explain inherent weakness in email infrastructure and methodologies to improve the security of the email infrastructure and also will highlight good and weak practices in varying aspects of email infrastructure design paradigm. The paper will also highlight the implementation of Email Security in IPS Academy.

AB  - Forensic tools are used to create critical evidence in computer-related crimes investigation. The evidence has an effect on judgment by the court and it requires verification of forensic tools. The verification should require an agreement of law enforcement organizations. Computer Forensic Tool Testing (CFTT) Verification project provides a measure of assurance that the tools used in the investigations produce valid results [1]. CFTT suggests requirements, assertions and test cases document for verification of forensic tools. There are hidden data in acquired image however CFTT do not deal with detection test on hidden data. Detection technology depends on cover carriers, such as images, audio, text or code represented digitally, hold the hidden data. This paper proposes preprocesses for detection of hidden data to be existed or not by forensic tools.

AB  - Growth of network technology and easy internet access are the key features for development and use of Database-as-a-Service (DaaS) technique. In DaaS technique it is necessary to ensure safe and correct operation of any industry. In many cases, the types of data records used to conduct security audits are considered sensitive, as they could reveal information about internal network structures, the types of software running, private customer or employee information. In this paper we suggest a technique based on system of linear equations, which enables a trusted party to give the service provider's server the ability to test whether a given keyword appears in log records but the server learns nothing about the keyword and the log content. We compare our scheme with existing encryption schemes and prove that our scheme is efficient and secure.

AB  - eXpert-BSM is a real time forward-reasoning expert system that analyzes Sun Solaris audit trails. Based on many years of intrusion detection research, eXpert-BSM's knowledge base detects a wide range of specific and general forms of misuse, provides detailed reports and recommendations to the system operator, and has a low false-alarm rate. Host-based intrusion detection offers the ability to detect misuse and subversion through the direct monitoring of processes inside the host, providing an important complement to network-based surveillance. Suites of eXpert-BSMs may be deployed throughout a network, and their alarms managed, correlated, and acted on by remote or local subscribing security services, thus helping to address issues of decentralized management. Inside the host, eXpert-BSM is intended to operate as a true security daemon for host systems, consuming few CPU cycles and very little memory and secondary storage. eXpert-BSM has been available for download on the Internet since April 2000, and has been successfully deployed in several production environments.

AB  - In this paper, we explore a quantitative approach to accountable wireless multi-hop networks. We propose using hierarchical P-Accountability to adapt the requirements of modeling a complex network environment and assess the degree of accountability in a fine-grained manner. We have defined P-Accountability and demonstrated its use in the hierarchical network environment. In addition, we apply P-Accountability to a wireless multi-hop network system. Both numerical and simulation results show that our approach is applicable to most accountable systems and that it provides a flexible and comprehensive view of the degree of accountability.

AB  - Accountability implies that any entity should be held responsible for its own specific action or behavior so that the entity is part of larger chains of accountability. One of the goals of accountability is that once an event has transpired, the events that took place are traceable so that the causes can be determined afterward. The poor accountability provided by today's computers and networks wastes a great deal of money and effort; examples include activities to identify whether a system is under reconnaissance or attack, and the difficulties of distinguishing legitimate emails from phishing attacks. This is due to the simple fact that today's computing and network infrastructure was not built with accountability in mind. In this article we propose a novel methodology called flow-net for accountability. We apply this methodology to media access control and routing layers in wireless networks. We then compare the performance of flow-net with audit log files. This article presents a novel approach for traffic data collection that can also be used for forensics and intrusion detection purposes.

AB  - Security log analysis is extremely useful for uncovering intrusions and anomalies. However, the sheer volume of log data demands new frameworks and techniques of computing and security. We present a lightweight distributed and parallel security log analysis framework that allows organizations to analyze a massive number of system, network, and transaction logs efficiently and scalably. Different from the general distributed frameworks, e.g., MapReduce, our framework is specifically designed for security log analysis. It features a minimum set of necessary properties, such as dynamic task scheduling for streaming logs. For prototyping, we implement our framework in Amazon cloud environments (EC2 and S3) with a basic analysis application. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our design and shows the potential of our cloud-based distributed framework in large-scale log analysis scenarios.

AB  - The key barrier to widespread uptake of cloud computing is the lack of trust in clouds by potential customers. While preventive controls for security and privacy are actively researched, there is still little focus on detective controls related to cloud accountability and audit ability. The complexity resulting from large-scale virtualization and data distribution carried out in current clouds has revealed an urgent research agenda for cloud accountability, as has the shift in focus of customer concerns from servers to data. This paper discusses key issues and challenges in achieving a trusted cloud through the use of detective controls, and presents the Trust Cloud framework, which addresses accountability in cloud computing via technical and policy-based approaches.

AB  - Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed over the Internet on an as-needed basis. A major feature of the cloud services is that users' data are usually processed remotely in unknown machines that users do not own or operate. While enjoying the convenience brought by this new emerging technology, users' fears of losing control of their own data (particularly, financial and health data) can become a significant barrier to the wide adoption of cloud services. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel highly decentralized information accountability framework to keep track of the actual usage of the users' data in the cloud. In particular, we propose an object-centered approach that enables enclosing our logging mechanism together with users' data and policies. We leverage the JAR programmable capabilities to both create a dynamic and traveling object, and to ensure that any access to users' data will trigger authentication and automated logging local to the JARs. To strengthen user's control, we also provide distributed auditing mechanisms. We provide extensive experimental studies that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

AB  - Computing resource provisioning through the use of the Cloud computing paradigm has triggered revolutions in modern day computing. It is a new paradigm for deploying services on rented machines. On the other hand, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has gained wide adoption among organizations due to the importance of collaborations and outsourcing. Therefore the Cloud's enormous capacity with comparable low cost makes it an ideal platform for SOA deployment. The overall correctness of the SOA deployed in the Cloud depends on the correctness of all individual participants. As the SOA usually spans multiple administration domains, concluding the faulty service and making the provider responsible become a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel design to achieve Trustworthy Service Oriented Architecture (TSOA) in the Cloud through enforcing strong accountability. In such system not only the root of a fault can always be concluded to the guilty participant(s), each conclusion is supported with non-disputable evidence. We also implemented a demonstrative system to show its effectiveness in real practice. Our testing figure indicates the cost of incorporating our design to SOA in the cloud is acceptable.

AB  - Cloud computing is receiving a great deal of attention, both in publications and among users, from individuals at home to the government. The cloud makes it possible for you to access your information from anywhere at any time. While a traditional computer setup requires you to be in the same location as your data storage device, the cloud takes away that step. The cloud removes the need for you to be in the same physical location as the hardware that stores your data. A major feature of the cloud services is that user data are usually processed remotely in unknown machines that users do not own or operate. Data handling in the cloud goes through a complex and dynamic hierarchical service chain which does not exist in conventional environments. This can be addressed by a novel approach, namely Cloud Information Accountability (CIA) framework. In this every access to the data are correctly and automatically logged. Log files should be sent back to their data owners periodically to inform them of the current usage of their data. More importantly, log files should be retrievable any time by their data owners when needed regardless the location where the files are stored. The end user is allowed to access the data as per their access privileges which they specifies while registering to access the data in the cloud and authentication is provided and accessed data is verified with the original data in the cloud server.

This paper discusses the need for a rigorous model of forensics and outlines qualities that such a model should possess. It presents an overview of a forensic model and an example of how to apply the model to a real-world, multi-stage attack. We show how using the model can result in forensic analysis requiring a much smaller amount of carefully selected, highly useful data than without the model

AB  - This paper describes a low-overhead and prolonged Linux process logging mechanism that is separated into networks for embedded systems with small memory. It is useful to log the behavior of Linux processes in Android in order to debug, test, and learn about the embedded systems. However, the logging system interferes with process scheduling and requires huge storage to capture the process behavior. We propose a separated Linux process logging mechanism to solve these problems. Two features are utilized to develop the mechanism.The first is an improved logging performance. When acquiring context switch log data from an operating system, some data may be lost because of limited memory. To solve this problem, we propose a low-overhead data generating, low-latency data gathering and sending mechanism. This has a lightweight binary and string data format that uses a context-dependent log compression algorithm.The second feature is the construction of a log data management system that is available over a network. The logging mechanism is separated into two parts - a Logging Environment (LE) and a Logging Monitoring Environment (LME) - to reduce the effect of the target device and increase the volume of log data stored area. The LE consists of a log generation part in the target embedded device and a log collection part on the server. The LME consists of various monitoring and debugging tools, such as a log analyzer or log visualizer. In order to utilize the tools on the LME, the generated log data is exported to the log collection server via the network by an embedded device. The collected log data can be converted to an application-friendly format, such as Common Trace Format (CTF) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), on the log collection server to reduce the overhead of the embedded device in the LE and be easily available to the LME tools. We utilize an HTTP-based communication protocol between the LE and LME.As a result of an evaluation, the latency of data gatheri- g and the overhead of data generation are decreased by 50%. The scheduling interference and the volume of log data also decrease. Our method is also comfortable transferring data across the network as well as CPU loading.

In olden days physical robbery was very high and now because of the advanced techniques to carry money and other valuables like ATM, people utilize the computer system to carry out robbery. Just like the olden days, where crime has to be investigated; now too the investigator has to investigate the digital crime. This paper presents some of the tools &amp; techniques to analyze the digital crime. The forensic techniques will be used to track where exactly the crime has taken place and where the valuable data are hidden, which are the mails have been sent and received from the seized computer system. The forensic analysis tools are used to analyze the data and to recover the deleted or hidden data from the digital devices.

AB  - Security event logs play a role in the early detection of attacks and in after incident investigations. Controllers used in SCADA, DCS and other control systems log almost no security events. This deficiency is addressed by the Quickdraw application, which is a passive security log generator for controllers. Quickdraw monitors communication like a network IDS, detects events that should be logged in a controller, creates the security events, and then sends the event to a historian, SEM or other log aggregator.

AB  - Most error-log analysis studies perform a statistical fit to the data assuming a single underlying error process. The authors present the results of an analysis that demonstrates that the log is composed of at least two error processes: transient and intermittent. The mixing of data from multiple processes requires many more events to verify a hypotheses using traditional statistical analysis. Based on the shape of the interarrival time function of the intermittent errors observed from actual error logs, a failure-prediction heuristic, the dispersion frame technique (DFT), is developed. The DFT was implemented in a distributed system for the campus-wide Andrew file system at Carnegie Mellon University. Data collected from 13 file servers over a 22-month period were analyzed using both the DFT and conventional statistical methods. It is shown that the DFT can extract intermittent errors from the error log and uses only one fifth of the error-log entry points required by statistical methods for failure prediction. The DFT achieved a 93.7% success rate in predicting failures in both electromechanical and electronic devices

Since the main question which influence the clustering algorithm application in the log analysis is uneasy to determine the network attack type and the cluster number, so we bring forward an optimized cluster algorithm to solve this problem. By means of simulated experiments, this algorithm is proved feasible, efficient and extensible for unknown intrusion detection.

AB  - This paper concerns the protection of a software program and/or the content that the program protects. Software piracy and digital media piracy have cost industries billions of dollars each year. The success of the content/software security technologies in a large part depends on the capability of protecting software code against tampering and detecting the attackers who distribute the pirate copies. In this paper, we focus on the attacker detection and forensic analysis. We shall talk about a proactive detection scheme for defeating an on-going attack before the compromise has occurred. We shall also briefly explain another detection scheme for post-compromise attacker identification. In particular, we consider real world scenarios where the application programs connect with their vendors periodically, and where a detection of attacking can bar a hacker user from further business.

AB  - The Linux operating system has been used as a server system in plenty of business services worldwide. Nowadays, a lot of incident response approaches on such kind of platform have been established by many researchers active in the computer forensic discipline. Interestingly, many frameworks about how to deal with a live digital investigation on a Linux systems have been illustrated in the forensic literature. Conversely, as a matter of fact, there are not so many tools for approaching live forensic of a Linux system. Thus, we have developed and implemented a new framework to deal with a compromised Linux system in a digital forensic investigation. The resulting framework has been called LECT (Linux Evidence Collection Tool) ant aims to represent a significant contribution in the field of live forensic analysis of Linux based systems.

Little attention has been put on exploiting the conceptual models developed during analysis for application evaluation, maintenance and evolution. We illustrates an approach for integrating the use of conceptual models in the lower part of the application life cycle, by exploiting them in quality analysis and usage evaluation. A prototype tool for supporting the described evaluation activities is also presented.

AB  - Frequent failure occurrences are becoming a serious concern to the community of high-end computing, especially when the applications and the underlying systems rapidly grow in size and complexity. In order to better understand the failure behavior of such systems and further develop effective fault-tolerant strategies, we have collected detailed event logs from IBM Blue Gene/L, which has as many as 128K processors, and is currently the fastest supercomputer in the world. Due to the scale of such machines and the granularity of the logging mechanisms, the logs can get voluminous and usually contain records which may not all be distinct. Consequently, it is crucial to filter these logs towards isolating the specific failures, which can then be useful for subsequent analysis. However, existing filtering methods either require too much domain expertise, or produce erroneous results. This paper thus fills this crucial void by designing and developing an adaptive semantic filtering (ASF) method, which is accurate, light-weight, and more importantly, easy to automate. Specifically, ASF exploits the semantic correlation between two events, and dynamically adapts the correlation threshold based on the temporal gap between the events. We have validated the ASF method using the failure logs collected from Blue Gene/L over a period of 98 days. Our experimental results show that ASF can effectively remove redundant entries in the logs, and the filtering results can serve as a good base for future failure analysis studies.

After creating a anomaly feature sets of the model, C4.5 algorithm was used to improve feature sets, making the abnormal records in feature sets store hierarchically. Compared logs in website with the treated feature stes, the model ultimately achieves the purpose of checking website's security event fast and accurately.

AB  - Transparency and confident towards cloud provider are some of the prominent issues in cloud today. In order to solve these problems, cloud service providers should have a high level of assurance and accountability in order to maintain trust between them and the users. This trust can be achieved through data provenance. Data provenance provides historical data from its original resources and can facilitate trust between cloud providers and users. This paper discusses the overview of data provenance in cloud computing and significant approach in provenance logging system. This is then followed by discussion of provenance challenges in cloud environment. Finally, this paper propose a novel data provenance trusted model to provide secured access to data provenance via a secured communication channel. This model also propose a consolidation log storage for virtual and physical layer in cloud environment.

AB  - Event logs have been widely used over the last three decades to analyze the failure behavior of a variety of systems. Nevertheless, the implementation of the logging mechanism lacks a systematic approach and collected logs are often inaccurate at reporting software failures: This is a threat to the validity of log-based failure analysis. This paper analyzes the limitations of current logging mechanisms and proposes a rule-based approach to make logs effective to analyze software failures. The approach leverages artifacts produced at system design time and puts forth a set of rules to formalize the placement of the logging instructions within the source code. The validity of the approach, with respect to traditional logging mechanisms, is shown by means of around 12,500 software fault injection experiments into real-world systems.

AB  - Different users apply computer forensic systems, models, and terminology in very different ways. They often make incompatible assumptions and reach different conclusions about the validity and accuracy of the methods they use to log, audit, and present forensic data. This is problematic, because these fields are related, and results from one can be meaningful to the others. We present several forensic systems and discuss situations in which they produce valid and accurate conclusions and also situations in which their accuracy is suspect. We also present forensic models and discuss areas in which they are useful and areas in which they could be augmented. Finally, we present some recommendations about how computer scientists, forensic practitioners, lawyers, and judges could build more complete models of forensics that take into account appropriate legal details and lead to scientifically valid forensic analysis.

AB  - Existing solutions for data protection and privacy in data outsourcing scenario generally emphasize on the access control model integrated with the advanced cryptographic techniques. However, the complexity of key management is still a recurrent problem when the environment composes of enormous numbers of users and several resource owners. In addition, the administrative capabilities to control the policies enforced in the collaborative cloud environment where several owners and users have not been explicitly provided by the existing works. In this paper, we propose a privacy enhancing access control model to address the scalability and fine-grained access control for outsourced data in multi-owner setting. The focus is to serve the privacy and integrity of outsourced data as well as the accountability. To this end, we employ a PKI key management and access control scheme to serve the security and privacy for the data, policy, and communication. We employ multi-agent system to accommodate multi-policy enforcement and support parallel processing of authorization requests. Our model supports both read and write access control and integrity of all access operations is served by signature-based that enables a full accountability of all accesses.

SCIP synthesizes contextual integrity concepts and enables query based solutions for two important privacy processes (compliance and obligation derivation). We include an experimental validation of the scalability of our approach.

AB  - The inability to effectively track data in cloud computing environments is becoming one of the top concerns for cloud stakeholders. This inability is due to two main reasons. Firstly, the lack of data tracking tools built for clouds. Secondly, current logging mechanisms are only designed from a system-centric perspective. There is a need for data-centric logging techniques which can trace data activities (e.g. file creation, edition, duplication, transfers, deletions, etc.) within and across all cloud servers. This will effectively enable full transparency and accountability for data movements in the cloud. In this paper, we introduce S2Logger, a data event logging mechanism which captures, analyses and visualizes data events in the cloud from the data point of view. By linking together atomic data events captured at both file and block level, the resulting sequence of data events depicts the cloud data provenance records throughout the data lifecycle. With this information, we can then detect critical data-related cloud security problems such as malicious actions, data leakages and data policy violations by analysing the data provenance. S2Logger also enables us to address the gaps and inadequacies of existing system-centric security tools.

AB  - Software log file analysis helps immensely in software testing and troubleshooting. The first step in automated log file analysis is extracting log data. This requires decoding the log file syntax and interpreting data semantics. The expected output of this phase is an organization of the extracted data for further processing. Log data extractors can be developed using popular programming languages targeting one or few log file formats. Rather than repeating this process for each log file format, it is desirable to have a generic scheme for interpreting elements of a log file and filling a data structure suitable for further processing. The new log data extraction scheme introduced in this paper is an attempt to provide the advanced features demanded by modern log file analysis procedures. It is a generic scheme which is capable of handling both text and binary log files with complex structures and difficult syntax. Its output is a tree filled with the information of interest for the particular case.

AB  - As cloud computing and virtualization technologies become mainstream, the need to be able to track data has grown in importance. Having the ability to track data from its creation to its current state or its end state will enable the full transparency and accountability in cloud computing environments. In this paper, we showcase a novel technique for tracking end-to-end data provenance, a meta-data describing the derivation history of data. This breakthrough is crucial as it enhances trust and security for complex computer systems and communication networks. By analyzing and utilizing provenance, it is possible to detect various data leakage threats and alert data administrators and owners; thereby addressing the increasing needs of trust and security for customers' data. We also present our rule-based data provenance tracing algorithms, which trace data provenance to detect actual operations that have been performed on files, especially those under the threat of leaking customers' data. We implemented the cloud data provenance algorithms into an existing software with a rule correlation engine, show the performance of the algorithms in detecting various data leakage threats, and discuss technically its capabilities and limitations.

AB  - Intrusion detection is the process of identifying and responding to suspicious activities targeted at computing and communication resources, and it has become the mainstream of information assurance as the dramatic increase in the number of attacks. Intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors and collects data from a target system that should be protected, processes and correlates the gathered information, and initiates responses when evidence of an intrusion is detected. In this paper, we designed and implemented a host-based intrusion detection system, which combines two detection technologies, one is log file analysis technology and the other is BP neural network technology. Log file analysis is an approach of misuse detection, and BP neural network is an approach of anomaly detection. By combination of these two kinds of detection technologies, the HIDS that we have implemented can effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection.

AB  - During recent years, establishing proper metrics for measuring system security has received increasing attention. Security logs contain vast amounts of information which are essential for creating many security metrics. Unfortunately, security logs are known to be very large, making their analysis a difficult task. Furthermore, recent security metrics research has focused on generic concepts, and the issue of collecting security metrics with log analysis methods has not been well studied. In this paper, we will first focus on using log analysis techniques for collecting technical security metrics from security logs of common types (e.g., Network IDS alarm logs, workstation logs, and Net flow data sets). We will also describe a production framework for collecting and reporting technical security metrics which is based on novel open-source technologies for big data.

AB  - Software functional testing can unveil a wide range of potential malfunctions in applications. However, there is a significant fraction of errors that will be hardly detected through a traditional testing process. Problems such as memory corruptions, memory leaks, performance bottlenecks, low-level system call failures and I/O errors might not surface any symptoms in a tester's machine while causing disasters in production. On the other hand, many handy tools have been emerging in all popular platforms allowing a tester or an analyst to monitor the behavior of an application with respect to these dark areas in order to identify potential fatal problems that would go unnoticed otherwise. Unfortunately, these tools are not yet in widespread use due to few reasons. First, the usage of tools requires a certain amount of expertise on system internals. Furthermore, these monitoring tools generate a vast amount of data even with elegant filtering and thereby demand a significant amount of time for an analysis even from experts. As the end result, using monitoring tools to improve software quality becomes a costly operation. Another facet of this problem is the lack of infrastructure to automate recurring analysis patterns. This paper describes the current state of an ongoing research in developing a framework that automates a significant part of the process of monitoring various quality aspects of a software application with the utilization of tools and deriving conclusions based on results. According to our knowledge this is the first framework to do this. It formulates infrastructure for analysts to extract relevant data from monitoring tool logs, process those data, make inferences and present analysis results to a wide range of stakeholders in a project.

Experiment result shows that the method can effectively compress log storage, reduce the time complexity, deal with actual dynamic data and realize incremental clustering.

The paperÂ¿s main idea is to achieve specialization, practical and convenience of log management system based on Struts frame which will fill the shortage of the current system. The achievement of this log management system provide simple-use and powerful-function mechanism for the most of information system which simplify the complicated operation for the current log system.

AB  - According to the trusted systems evaluation criteria (TCSEC) paradigm, if untrusted subjects are constrained by the trusted computer base (TCB), they may safely execute software of unknown assurance while accessing sensitive information. Untrusted subjects, however, can leak sensitive information, undermine the TCB's accountability mechanisms, and destroy information integrity. Hence, the security properties needed by many organizations cannot be enforced at the TCSEC security perimeter, i.e., the TCB interface. We propose an alternative approach that redraws the security perimeter of a trusted system so that it encompasses not only a TCSEC TCB but the Controlled Application Set (CAS), a collection of software components for which some assurance of benign behavior has been obtained. Non-CAS components may also be present on a system bird may be used to manipulate only non-sensitive information. The approach advocates a form of balanced assurance in which the assurance sought for CAS components is commensurate with residual security risks they present. We propose practical assurance requirements, including new functional requirements for TCBs. Examples illustrate the applicability of the approach to confidentiality, accountability, and integrity

AB  - Forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past two decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.

AB  - Contemporary information systems such as: eLearning, eUnivesity, eVoting, eHealth, etc., are frequently used and misused for irregular data changes (data tampering). Those facts force us to reconsider our security measures and find a way to improve them. Proving a computer crime act require very complicated processes which are based on digital evidence collecting, forensic analysis and investigation process. Forensic analysis of database systems is very specific and demanding task and therefore presents main inspiration for our research. In this paper we present the fact that classical methods of collecting digital evidence are not appropriate and efficient. In order to improve efficiency we propose combination of well know technology independent methods from database world and their application in field of forensic science. Also we are proposed some new research direction in this area.

AB  - This paper comprehends our work on assessing the feasibility of utilizing different NoSQL databases in handling a huge tree data structure with heterogeneous nodes in which heterogeneity implies that each node can embody a unique attribute set. It is a prominent requirement arising in structured log analysis where constituents in a software log file are scrutinized hierarchically. Traditional pills from relational databases fail in handling this efficiently. We lean towards NoSQL paradigm, which has been emerging as a prominent solution for dealing with high volumes of data with localized characteristics. Our exploration probes five different NoSQL models: wide column store, document store, tuple store, graph databases and multi-model databases that collectively account for a large fraction of the entire NoSQL spectrum. An experiment is designed to measure database performance against a generic tree API focusing on node insertion, node query and attribute-value query. The API is then implemented in a database selected from each of the five NoSQL models in concern. Implementations are used for testing the database performance with respect to the three operations by measuring time taken for a batch of similar operations in a machine with average hardware and software configuration. A summary of experiment results is provided along with the details on tree implementation methodology in each database. A discussion that highlights the congruence between observed performance differences among databases and the theoretical NoSQL models they represent is also included.

AB  - Timestamps are widely used in computing and offer an easy way to determine the time of events in digital investigations. Unfortunately, the ability of users to change clock settings, the difficult to recover the multi-level overwriting data in a disk, etc. can not provide the efficient timestamp for event reasoning. In this paper, we present techniques to use lay technique to deal with the time of a file on local machine, even its data block of a file had been re-written many times or deleted long ago, and adopt the time offset mechanism to deal with the deviation time of the file at time t. Use a logging mechanism to record the time of modifications to each disk block and its deviation time at time t to calculate the real time of a file for reasoning the order of the events and obtaining a timeline of activities on a file.

AB  - Health care industries are adopting Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system from paper based records. With EMR, health services can be provided at accelerated rate but privacy, security and storage of information will be of concern. There are different regulations for the use and disclosure of health information. In this research study, we focus on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and discuss how it protects health information of an individual while allowing the flow of information to carry out necessary health care functions. The web based EMR system is proposed based on security and privacy features defined by HIPAA.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel secure auditing scheme for cloud computing systems. Several auditing schemes have been proposed for the cloud, which periodically trigger the auditing function. These schemes are designed to monitor the performance and behavior of the cloud. One major problem with these kind of schemes is that they are vulnerable to the transient attack (also known as the timed scrubbing attack). Our secure auditing scheme is able to prevent the transient attack via modification of the Linux auditing daemon - auditd, which creates attestable logs. Our scheme utilizes the System Management Mode (SMM) for integrity checks and the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip for attestable security. Specifically, we modify the auditing daemon protocol such that it records a hash of each audit log entry to the TPM's Platform Configuration Register (PCR), which gives us an attestable history of every command executed on the cloud server. We perform real experiments on two cloud servers and the results show that the overhead of our scheme is very small.

AB  - Secure logs are powerful tools for building systems that must resist forgery, prove temporal relationships, and stand up to forensic scrutiny. The proofs of order and integrity encoded in these tamper-evident chronological records, typically built using hash chaining, may be used by applications to enforce operating constraints or sound alarms at suspicious activity. However, existing research stops short of discussing how one might go about automatically determining whether a given secure log satisfies a given set of constraints on its records. In this paper, we discuss our work on Querifier, a tool that accomplishes this. It can be used offline as an analyzer for static logs, or online during the runtime of a logging application. Querifier rules are written in a flexible pattern-matching language that adapts to arbitrary log structures; given a set of rules and available log data, Querifier presents evidence of correctness and offers counterexamples if desired. We describe Querfier's implementation and offer early performance results.

AB  - The most major threat of Android users is malware infection via Android application markets. In case of the Android Market, as security inspections are not applied for many users have uploaded applications. Therefore, malwares, e.g., Geimini and Droid Dream will attempt to leak personal information, getting root privilege, and abuse functions of the smart phone. An audit framework called log cat is implemented on the Dalvik virtual machine to monitor the application behavior. However, only the limited events are dumped, because an application developers use the log cat for debugging. The behavior monitoring framework that can audit all activities of applications is important for security inspections on the market places. In this paper, we propose a kernel-base behavior analysis for android malware inspection. The system consists of a log collector in the Linux layer and a log analysis application. The log collector records all system calls and filters events with the target application. The log analyzer matches activities with signatures described by regular expressions to detect a malicious activity. Here, signatures of information leakage are automatically generated using the smart phone IDs, e.g., phone number, SIM serial number, and Gmail accounts. We implement a prototype system and evaluate 230 applications in total. The result shows that our system can effectively detect malicious behaviors of the unknown applications.

AB  - Describes typical operations channels for a circuit switch and the generic requirements that should be met to secure these channels. The author discusses the technical analysis of these features, and the major results obtained from analyses of circuit switches produced by various vendors. The general technological trend in switch design has been to incorporate a flexible architecture that allows assigning any operations function to any input port; the assignments are software-driven. The newer switches, in general, all provide this flexibility. All switches have login features that can be deployed on a majority of operations channels. Different switches have different levels of protection against password cracking. Time-out is a common feature among switches and resource control is available on a limited basis. Except for a few conspicuous exceptions, switches generally provide a security log and associated audit features

AB  - Cephalometric analysis involves the landmarking of several points which must be taken into consideration with great care since an error on only one point can have great impact on linear and angle measurements. For this reason we developed a software tool that allows student to practice in cephalometric landmarking. Their analysis can be saved and modified at a later time by the student or by the instructor. The student can also see the cephalometric analysis performed by the instructor, thus obtaining an immediate feedback that stimulates self-reflection. Finally the tool allows for CNN applications that highlight anatomical regions and landmarks and eases their detection. The tool was used in several situations with and without embossing and with different monitor size. The impact of the tool in the learning process is evaluated by analysis of the software log. Analysis of the application log revealed statistics about the time spent for the identification of each landmark, the improvements in landmarking performance are measured as a decrease in the time needed for the overall analysis or as distance from the gold standard computed as mean expert landmark coordinates. Finally, an analysis of a questionnaire administered to the users reveals an appreciation of the software tool that was considered very engaging.

AB  - Over time, laws change to meet evolving social needs. Requirements engineers that develop software for regulated domains, such as healthcare or finance, must adapt their software as laws change to maintain legal compliance. In the United States, regulatory agencies will almost always release a proposed regulation, or rule, and accept comments from the public. The agency then considers these comments when drafting a final rule that will be binding on the regulated domain. Herein, we examine how these proposed rules evolve into final rules, and propose an Adaptability Framework. This framework can aid software engineers in predicting what areas of a proposed rule are most likely to evolve, allowing engineers to begin building towards the more stable sections of the rule. We develop the framework through a formative study using the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Security Rule and apply it in a summative study on the Health Information Technology: Initial Set of Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria for Electronic Health Record Technology.

AB  - Typical Hadoop setups employ Direct Attached Storage (DAS) with compute nodes and uniform replication of data to sustain high I/O throughput and fault tolerance. However, not all data is accessed at the same time or rate. Thus, if a large replication factor is used to support higher throughput for popular data, it wastes storage by unnecessarily replicating unpopular data as well. Conversely, if less replication is used to conserve storage for the unpopular data, it means fewer replicas for even popular data and thus lower I/O throughput. We present Apt Store, a dynamic data management system for Hadoop, which aims to improve overall I/O throughput while reducing storage cost. We design a tiered storage that uses the standard DAS for popular data to sustain high I/O throughput, and network-attached enterprise filers for cost-effective, fault-tolerant, but lower-throughput storage for unpopular data. We design a file Popularity Prediction Algorithm (PPA) that analyzes file system audit logs and predicts the appropriate storage policy of each file, as well as use the information for transparent data movement between tiers. Our evaluation of Apt Store on a real cluster shows 21.3% improvement in application execution time over standard Hadoop, while trace driven simulations show 23.7% increase in read throughput and 43.4% reduction in the storage capacity requirement of the system.

AB  - Database outsourcing is emerging as an important trend in which the data owners ship their data to external service provider. Since a service provider is not fully trusted, security and privacy are significant issues. They can be referred to as data confidentiality, user and data privacy, query assurance and secure auditing. Among them, secure auditing takes an important role to have a secure database outsourcing model. While audit log provides investigator information to assess past system activity, it often contains sensitive information. We need to protect it from unauthorized parties while making it still efficiently searchable by authorized ones. In this paper, we propose a novel searchable encryption scheme, named PEKS-PM, based on pseudo inverse matrix, which enables a trusted party to give the service provider's server the ability to test whether a given keyword appears in log records but the server learns nothing about the keyword and the log content. Our encryption scheme is based mainly on linear matrix operations therefore the complexity is low. We prove that our proposed encryption scheme is secure and efficient, comparing with an encryption scheme based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption.

AB  - Current Web browsers are plagued with vulnerabilities, providing hackers with easy access to computer systems via browser-based attacks. Browser security efforts that retrofit existing browsers have had limited success because the design of modern browsers is fundamentally flawed. To enable more secure web browsing, we design and implement a new browser, called the OP Web browser, that attempts to improve the state-of-the-art in browser security. Our overall design approach is to combine operating system design principles with formal methods to design a more secure Web browser by drawing on the expertise of both communities. Our overall design philosophy is to partition the browser into smaller subsystems and make all communication between subsystems simple and explicit. At the core of our design is a small browser kernel that manages the browser subsystems and interposes on all communications between them to enforce our new browser security features. To show the utility of our browser architecture, we design and implement three novel security features. First, we develop novel and flexible security policies that allows us to include plugins within our security framework. Our policy removes the burden of security from plugin writers, and gives plugins the flexibility to use innovative network architectures to deliver content while still maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of our browser, even if attackers compromise the plugin. Second, we use formal methods to prove that the address bar displayed within our browser user interface always shows the correct address for the current Web page. Third, we design and implement a browser-level information-flow tracking system to enable post-mortem analysis of browser-based attacks. If an attacker is able to compromise our browser, we highlight the subset of total activity that is causally related to the attack, thus allowing users and system administrators to determine easily which Web site lead to the compromise and- to assess the damage of a successful attack. To evaluate our design, we implemented OP and tested both performance and filesystem impact. To test performance, we measure latency to verify OP's performance penalty from security features are be minimal from a users perspective. Our experiments show that on average the speed of the OP browser is comparable to Firefox and the audit log occupies around 80 KB per page on average.

AB  - An important data source for intrusion forensics is various types of logs from the systems and networks being investigated. However, there are still many problems when using these logs for forensic analysis. Firstly, with the development of computers and Internet, intrusion behaviors involve more types and more quantities of logs, and these massive and complex log evidences make forensics analyst overwhelmed. Secondly, among the large number of logs that investigators need to analyze, the data related to criminal behaviors only accounts for a very small proportion and most of the rest data are useless records resulted from normal behaviors. Large amount of forensic data and high proportion of useless records make it very difficult to investigate and collect evidences. In addition, this makes criminal behaviors that submerged in a large amount of useless records easily overlooked. This paper introduces a new method for the reduction of candidate log evidences for intrusion forensics. Its main idea is to extract the key attribute fields as features of log records and assign a score to each log record. This score is used to indicate the degree of redundancy of the record. The greater the score is, the more likely the records are redundant. Our experiments based on Darpa2000 and Snort real-world data show that this method can significantly reduce the interference caused by useless data for forensic analysis: it removes 57% and 82% useless data in Darpa2000 and the Snort real-world data, respectively.

AB  - This paper proposes the design of multi-user authentication in the multi-application based environment and role-based access control by using PKI Authentication and X.509 privilege management infrastructure (PMI). A binding model of RBAC authorization based on attribute certificate (AC) and public key certificate (PKC) is presented. Especially, the way of attribute mapping between PKC, bridge AC, and role AC is illustrated. In addition, the activity-based policy enforcement is introduced to make the system respond to malicious activities more appropriately. At a core, the multi agent system approach is applied to automate the flexible and effective management of user authentication, role delegation as well as system accountability. Finally, we reported our ongoing implementation status and demonstrated that our proposed model is a potential solution to support strong authentication and dynamic authorization in the multi-user and multi-application environment.

AB  - This paper proposes a hybrid model of an authentication technique and a role based access control (RBAC) based on X.509 public key certificate and attribute certificate. With attribute certificate the user role is bound to an identity of the public key certificate in which the permissions are assigned to the holder. A mapping model of RBAC authorization and authentication is presented. In addition, we also deal with the issue of system service disruption and recovery as well as an activity-based policy. With our proposed model, the full authentication, authorization, and accountability (AAA) are supported. We apply the multi agent system concept to facilitate the authentication and the authorization based on the PKI infrastructure. Finally, the project called AmTRUE (authentication management and trusted role-based authorization in multi-application and multi-user environment) has been developed to implement our research idea.

AB  - Monitoring the status of running applications is a real life requirement and important research area. In particular log analysis is often required to understand how the system is behaving during execution. For example it is common for system administrators to collect and view logs from different hardware and software components to gain an understanding into system behavior, especially during activities such as problem determination. A recent research project in this area, the Run Time Correlation Engine (RTCE), provides a framework for run-time correlation of distributed log files in a scalable manner for enterprise applications. The framework has been designed for enterprise applications consisting of distributed software components and is in use in real industry environments. The purpose of this paper is to explore how the RTCE can scale for cloud computing environments where providers of cloud services will require large architectures (e.g. data centers) to deploy such services.

AB  - With the advent and acceptance of cloud computing the ability to record and account for the usage of cloud resources in a convincing and capricious way has become critical for cloud service providers and users alike. The billing process involves receiving billing records from various networks, determining the billing rates associated with the billing records, calculate the cost for each billing record, aggregating this records periodically to generate invoices, sending invoices to the customer, and collecting payments received from the customer. Traditional billing systems are not enough in terms of security capabilities or computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a secure and no obstructive billing system called THEMIS as a remedy for these limitations. The system uses a novel concept of a cloud notary authority for the supervision of billing. Moreover, to provide a falsification-resistive SLA monitoring mechanism, we devised a SLA monitoring module enhanced with a trusted platform module (TPM), called S-Mon. From the perspective of extensibility, THEMIS is moreover applicable to various target services as well to improve the accountability of each service by applying more monitoring techniques to S-Mon. The overall latency of these systems is shorter and the throughput much higher than the Public key Infrastructure.

AB  - One major problem faced by end-users and administrators of computational grid environments arise in connection with the usability of the security mechanisms usually deployed in these environments, in particular identity management. Many of the existing computational grid environments use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and X.509 digital certificates as a corner stone for their security architectures. However, security solutions based on PKI have to be usable to be effective otherwise they will not provide the intended protection. This paper presents the Audited Credential Delegation (ACD), a user-centric security identity management solution that accommodates users and resource providers security requirements including authentication, authorisation and auditing security goals from the design level. The proposed architecture removes any association between users and digital certificates, which is the source of the grid usability problem, while addressing resource providers concerns with regards to accountability. A prototype of this architecture has been implemented in Java and Web Services technologies using the recommendations of the Open Web Application Security consortium (OWASP) for developing secure software. It is currently being tested on TeraGrid, NGS and DEISA grid infrastructures and a detailed usability study is underway.

AB  - When computer intrusions occur, one of the most costly, time-consuming, and human-intensive tasks is to analysis and take the evidence of the compromised system. IR4CF: a system call based intrusion replay system for supporting the computer forensics. IR4CF uses three key mechanisms to improve the accuracy and reduce the human overhead of performing forensic analysis. First, it streams the kernel event information in real-time, to append-only storage on a separate, hardened, logging machine, making the system resilient to a wide variety of attacks. Second, it uses system-call hijacking technology to perform comprehensive monitoring of the execution of a target system at the kernel event level, giving a high-resolution, application-independent view of all activity. Third, it analyses and replays the intrusion actions dynamically, which can be used for evidence in a court of law.

AB  - As the Internet becomes pervasive, the vulnerability of some fundamental design aspects of the Internet has also become significant. Among which, denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed DoS (DDoS) pose significant problems, as they are disruptive to the useful traffics and are hard to prevent. One solution consists in instituting accountability, which hold the attackers accountable for the attack. The key issue is to identify the real sources of the attacks and attackers use spoofed IP address to hide their actual network location. However, the Internet architecture does not provide intrinsic support for identifying the real sources of IP packets. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to traceback the real sources. Most of such networks have been addressing the IP version 4. In this paper, we address the issues of IP traceback in the context of IPv6 and mobile IPv6. This paper provides a detailed analysis of these issues and problems. The main problem lies with the transformations that are introduced by IPv6 and mobile IPv6 protocols, namely tunneling and addresses manipulation. We then propose a solution, including new ICMPv6 messages for traceback co-ordination, to facilitate the traceback mechanism.

AB  - A new user-mode Linux based virtual honeynet architecture is presented in this paper. The new architecture has improved functionality that is difficult to realize in the GenII honeynet. Two new honeynet capabilities in particular are introduced. Honeypot controller is a new virtual honeynet component that assists in data control. The honeywall promises to have finer control over the honeypots through signal and system call redirections. The second new capability is the disk imager. The disk imager is capable of making forensic images of the virtual machine's file systems for further analysis. Since security for virtual honeynets is a big concern, the new virtual honeynet architecture utilizes security enhanced Linux to isolate the untrusted honeypots from the completely trusted honeywall. SELinux and other research work done in this field made the new honeynet architecture a viable alternative to GenII honeynets. A file system logging mechanism, FSLog, has been developed for the UML based virtual honeynet. In conjunction with the built-in tty logger, UML based honeynets have logging capabilities that are equivalent to their GenII honeynet counterparts. The current version of FSLog successfully logs eighteen virtual file systems system calls including the common, read(), write(), open() and close() functions. Its current functionality and how it pieces into the new architecture is also discussed. This work provides researchers with an alternative honeynet platform. The new virtual honeynet architecture is more portable, easier to setup, more cost effective and as secure as the GenII honeynet. The addition of the honeypot controller and disk imager components also makes the new virtual honeynet architecture more capable.

The goal with this phase of the work is to implement the proposed method and evaluate the forensic validity of the method under real-world conditions. This paper discusses that implementation and the ability for the generated authentication logs and access fingerprints to both identify malicious activity and identify the source of this activity. While work has been done to develop secure log files, i.e., making them tamper resistant, there has been no prior work to ensure they are forensically valid.

AB  - In classified information system, network security is often described as the cornerstone, and network components (such as routers and switches) are central assets. However, security management is usually based on IOS command only, which may cause the loss of network assurance. This article described the application of AAA security management in certain classified information network environment. To evaluate the enhancement the security protection, we compared the meet of standard for protection of state secrets, account security, log security, operation and audit facilitation by a designed prospective, randomized and compared study. The results showed that the AAA group was in accordance with standard for protection of state secrets, meanwhile AAA security management could provide safer account, more traceable log, and less time-consuming operation and audit. Based on the results, we strongly recommended that AAA security management should be widely applied to classified network.

AB  - The VAX security kernel, a prototype security kernel implemented as a virtual machine monitor (VMM) for the VAX architecture, is capable of emulating one or more virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine allowing multiple copies of virtual machine operating systems to execute concurrently. The system supports both VMS and ULTRIX as virtual machine operating systems. A fundamental component of any security kernel is the ability to produce an audit trial of security relevant events. While there are numerous examples of auditing subsystems at the DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) C2 or B1 level, there is much less experience with the requirements at the B2 level and above. The design and implementation of the VAX security kernel auditing facility, built to satisfy the requirements at the A1 level, are described

AB  - Cloud computing enables the use of Internet services as - needed basis. An important issue in the cloud is assuring privacy for the data stored in the cloud. There is a great challenge in providing security for the data shared in cloud and also prevent leakage of confidential data. To overcome this problem we introduce a novel approach with more secured CIA framework. We introduce auditing mechanisms and for providing trust for cloud users. Logs are maintained and sent periodically to the data owner. To provide security for the data file we encode the file using Base64 algorithm. This paper discusses key challenges in achieving privacy and trust based cloud through the use of secured detecting mechanisms which monitors the actions in cloud via technical and policy-based approaches.

AB  - We focus on dynamic monitoring of security and privacy policies in service oriented architectures (SOAs) based systems. In a service oriented system both the internal and the external services may easily interact with each other, which makes the establishment and the enforcement of the privacy policies and the rules across the systems increasingly challenging. We introduce efficient and flexible methods for auditing such systems by leveraging the middleware platform capabilities. The auditing methods allow for two different types of audits, the static audits and the dynamic audits. The static audits find out whether a process pattern that is defined by the audit has been executed in the system. The dynamic audits, however, find out on-the-fly whether any of the system policies are being violated as the service process flows are still in execution in the system. We also present the effectiveness of the dynamic monitoring that we have developed to support demanding requirements of the dynamic audits.

AB  - Service-oriented systems facilitate business workflows to span multiple organizations (e.g. by means of Web services). As a side effect, data may be more easily transferred over organizational boundaries. Thus, privacy issues arise. At the same time, there are personal, business and legal requirements for protecting privacy and IPR and allowing customers to request information about how and by whom their data was handled. Managing these requirements constitutes an unsolved technical and organizational problem. We propose to solve the information request problem by attaching meta-knowledge about how data was handled to the data itself. We present our solution, in form of an architecture, a formalization and an implemented prototype for logging and collecting logs in service-oriented and cross-organizational systems.

AB  - We propose an abstract model of business processes for the purpose of (i) evaluating privacy policy in light of the goals of the process and (ii) developing automated support for privacy policy compliance and audit. In our model, agents that send and receive tagged personal information are assigned organizational roles and responsibilities. We present approaches and algorithms for determining whether a business process design simultaneously achieves privacy and the goals of the organization (utility). The model also allows us to develop a notion of minimal exposure of personal information, for a given process. We investigate the problem of auditing with inexact information and develop methods to identify a set of potentially culpable individuals when privacy is breached. The audit methods draw on traditional causality concepts to reduce the effort needed to search audit logs for irresponsible actions.

The model is implemented in Linux, a real world operating system.

AB  - MFP (Multi-Function Peripheral) is an embedded system that serves several functions including printing, copying, scanning, faxing, document storing, and etc. Recently, MFP is becoming a popular option for office workers due to its multi-functionality and economic efficiency. Furthermore, MFP is able to perform several functions such as USB printing, private job printing, stored job printing, and scan-to-server. Due to the rapid growth of MFP market, MFP is widely used in many workspaces. Therefore, if we can extract meaningful information from MFP's storage devices, it may be valuable evidences in digital forensic investigation. However, systematic forensic investigation about MFP has never been studied so far. In this paper, we describe a process for digital forensic examination of MFP and analyze the acquired data and effectively trace the use of MFP in the crime scene.

AB  - Event logs are the primary source of data to characterize the dependability behavior of a computing system during the operational phase. However, they are inadequate to provide evidence of software faults, which are nowadays among the main causes of system outages. This paper proposes an approach based on software fault injection to assess the effectiveness of logs to keep track of software faults triggered in the field. Injection results are used to provide guidelines to improve the ability of logging mechanisms to report the effects of software faults. The benefits of the approach are shown by means of experimental results on three widely used software systems.

It concentrates on those architectural structures-whether hardware or software-that are necessary to support information protection. The paper develops in three main sections. Section I describes desired functions, design principles, and examples of elementary protection and authentication mechanisms. Any reader familiar with computers should find the first section to be reasonably accessible. Section II requires some familiarity with descriptor-based computer architecture. It examines in depth the principles of modern protection architectures and the relation between capability systems and access control list systems, and ends with a brief analysts of protected subsystems and protected objects. The reader who is dismayed by either the prerequisites or the level of detail in the second section may wish to skip to Section III, which reviews the state of the art and current research projects and provides suggestions for further reading.

AB  - Measuring security is an important step in creating and deploying secure applications. In order to efficiently measure the level of security that an application provides, three problems need to be solved: obviously metrics need to be available, a suitable metrics framework needs to be chosen and implemented, and the resulting measurements need to be interpreted. This work focuses on the second and third problem. We propose an approach to facilitate the selection and integration of appropriate security metrics, and to support the aggregation and interpretation of measurements. Our approach associates security metrics to security patterns, and we exploit the relationships between security patterns and security objectives to enable the interpretation of measurements. The approach is illustrated in a case study.

AB  - Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the de facto standard for preventing eavesdropping, tampering or message forgery of higher-risk Internet communications, for example when making a payment. At heart TLS is a stateful cryptographic protocol built around a public key infrastructure (PKI). However TLS is configurable; at one extreme it provides little protection and at the other end of the scale it provides protection against most threats to an Internet communication. In practice the ldquoIrdquo part of PKI is often not available at the client end so only the server end is authenticated. In this paper an optional TLS extension is proposed that dispenses with the need for the client to be registered with a PKI registration authority and instead uses a payment card to authenticate the user. This facilitates wider use of the available TLS services and can provide additional security services: enhanced privacy and certain non-repudiation services, for example.

AB  - Most statistical methods do not perfectly conform to real cases of cyber crimes. Consequently, using statistical methods to analyze intrusion logs in order to present evidentiary values in courts of law are often refuted as baseless and inadmissible evidences regardless of the input spent to generate the reports and whether the reports are well-grounded evidences or not. Sometimes, complainants are often bewildered and confused because it is almost certain that the prime suspects will be absolved in courts of law. These are tragic developments to computer security experts, corporate and private organizations that leverage on the usage of the Internet facilities to boost service delivery, business activities and profitability. Thus, this paper presents non-statistical metrics that adopt Serialization Modelling Method (S2M) to improve interpretations of intrusion logs. The approach instantiates tokens and serializes alerts triggered by Snort using well-defined values. Experiments illustrate that duplicate tokens or patterns of alerts that exhibit increased propensity are indicative of redundant alerts to a certain degree.

B-SIPS enabled hosts are employed as sensors in a wireless network and form the basis of the intrusion detection system (IDS). This detection capability is scalable and complementary with existing commercial and open system network IDSs. B-SIPS implementation correlates device power consumption with IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi and 802.15.1 Bluetooth communication activity. Irregular and attack activity is detected and reported to the intrusion detection engine for correlation with existing signatures in a database and for forensic investigation by a security manager

AB  - Various reports of information security breaches, unintended information disclosures of confidential patient information, and computer attacks have raised the awareness about security issues of health information systems (HIS). This paper explores the interrelation between the use of information systems and information system security in the hospital sector of the health Industry. It analyzes organizational, regulatory, and technological factors as well as difficulties inherent to health care organizations such as patient safety concerns and the use of these systems by clinicians who rely on timely and correct clinical information about their patients. Technical and organizational security capabilities are discussed with reference to case studies of two academic medical centers and two hospital groups in the United States and Switzerland. It is shown how the practicability of information security controls is limited by the heterogeneous and decentralized nature of HIS and the way in which clinicians use them.

AB  - A growing number of applications in the Internet are making use of X.509 public key certificates. Examples include security protocols such as SSL (used in web browsers), IPsec (used in firewalls and desktop computers), S/MIME (a secure e-mail protocol), and SET (the electronic commerce credit card transaction protocol). The public key certificates employed by the applications are created by Certification Authorities (CAs), that vouch for the binding of various attributes (e.g., identity) to a public key. Thus security of these applications is dependent on the security of the CA function. This paper examines security for CAs. It begins with a characterization of security requirements for CAs and continues with an exploration of the wide range of attacks that can be mounted against CAs. Included are attacks against network communications, against the operating systems used by CAs, &ldquo;close-in&rdquo; technical attacks against CA components (including cryptographic modules), and even misbehavior by human operators. The paper concludes with an examination of three approaches to implementing CA cryptographic support functions, analyzing each relative to the attack scenarios developed earlier in the paper

AB  - A dramatic shift is underway in how organizations use computer storage. This shift will have a profound impact on storage system design. The requirement for storage of traditional transactional data is being supplemented by the necessity to store information for long periods. In 2005, a total of 2,700 petabytes of storage was allocated worldwide for information that required long-term retention, and this amount is expected to grow to an estimated 27,200 petabytes by 2010. In this paper, we review the requirements for long-term storage of data and describe an innovative approach for developing a highly scalable and flexible archive storage system using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Such a system is expected to be capable of preserving data for decades, providing efficient policy-based management of the data, and allowing efficient search and access to data regardless of data content or location.

AB  - Auditing is a key part of the security infrastructure in a database system. While commercial database systems provide mechanisms such as triggers that can be used to track and log any changes made to &#x201C;sensitive&#x201D; data using UPDATE queries, they are not useful for tracking accesses to sensitive data using complex SQL queries, which is important for many applications given recent laws such as HIPAA. In this paper, we propose the notion of SELECT triggers that extends triggers to work for SELECT queries in order to facilitate data auditing. We discuss the challenges in integrating SELECT triggers in a database system including specification, semantics as well as efficient implementation techniques. We have prototyped our framework in a commercial database system and present an experimental evaluation of our framework using the TPC-H benchmark.

AB  - The development of a virtual-machine monitor (VMM) security kernel for the VAX architecture is described. The focus is on how the system's hardware, microcode, and software are aimed at meeting A1-level security requirements while maintaining the standard interfaces and applications of the VMS and ULTRIX-32 operating systems. The VAX security kernel supports multiple concurrent virtual machines on a single VAX system, providing isolation and controlled sharing of sensitive data. Rigorous engineering standards were applied during development to comply with the assurance requirements for verification and configuration management. The VAX security kernel has been developed with a heavy emphasis on performance and system management tools. The kernel performs sufficiently well that much of its development was carried out in virtual machines running on the kernel itself, rather than in a conventional time-sharing system

AB  - Large scale distributed systems comprising many administration domains have been well-researched. An example is a national health service, with domains such as primary care practices, hospitals, specialist clinics, etc. A new and relatively unexplored scenario is technology-assisted living, in which domains are small, dynamically created, and is associated with units of personal living. There is a great deal of commercial interest in providing technology to support assisted living, but services are created in isolation. We explore how such services could be integrated with a system that can ensure security and privacy. We propose to audit both system behaviour and the actions of principals, holding particular regard to the fulfillment of their obligations, to establish a computational expression of the trust to be associated with each principal

These hosts are employed as sensors in a wireless network and form the basis of the "Canary-Net" intrusion detection system (IDS). This detection capability is scalable and complementary with existing commercial and open system network IDSs. B-SIPS implementation correlates device power consumption with IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth communication activity. Irregular and attack activity is detected and reported to the intrusion detection engine for correlation with existing signatures in a database and for forensic investigation by a security manager

AB  - The significant threats of traditional worms such as Blaster, Sasser, Code Red and Slammer are still continuing due to their hasty spreading nature on the internet. The worms attack pattern from three different scenarios have been extracted from various logs at different OSI layers such as victim logs, attacker logs and IDS alert log. These worms attack pattern are further analyzed to form the general worms' attack pattern which describes the process of worms' infection. This paper proposes a general attack pattern for worm in three different perspectives which is attacker, victim and victim/attacker or multi-step attack using only Blaster variant. Thus, the general attack pattern can be extended into research areas in alert correlation and computer forensic investigation.

AB  - Establishing electronic exchange of information among collaborating organisations is a key goal in the public and private sector today. The desire to reduce costs while providing higher quality of service are two main drivers for this development. Confidential information about individual clients is often part of the information to be exchanged. Today, the handling of such information is governed by increasingly stringent privacy legislations. Ensuring compliance of such legislations during cross-organisational information mediation requires advanced middleware mechanisms. In this paper, we analyse requirements on such mechanisms and describe their prototypical realisation in the application domain of health care

RecIF uses propagation graphs to formally capture the data flow within a process execution. Abstracting away from the concrete traces, propagation graphs are analyzed with extensional data flow policies that denote what - instead of how - relevant industrial requirements, e.g. Chinese Wall and separation of duty constraints, are to be achieved. An example and the corresponding runtime figures demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

AB  - In this paper, we address issues related to the modeling, analysis, and countermeasures of worm attacks on the Internet. Most previous work assumed that a worm always propagates itself at the highest possible speed. Some newly developed worms (e.g., &#x201C;Atak&#x201D; worm) contradict this assumption by deliberately reducing the propagation speed in order to avoid detection. As such, we study a new class of worms, referred to as self-disciplinary worms. These worms adapt their propagation patterns in order to reduce the probability of detection, and eventually, to infect more computers. We demonstrate that existing worm detection schemes based on traffic volume and variance cannot effectively defend against these self-disciplinary worms. To develop proper countermeasures, we introduce a game-theoretic formulation to model the interaction between the worm propagator and the defender. We show that an effective integration of multiple countermeasure schemes (e.g., worm detection and forensics analysis) is critical for defending against self-disciplinary worms. We propose different integrated schemes for fighting different self-disciplinary worms, and evaluate their performance via real-world traffic data.

AB  - Software logging is a conventional programming practice. While its efficacy is often important for users and developers to understand what have happened in the production run, yet software logging is often done in an arbitrary manner. So far, there have been little study for understanding logging practices in real world software. This paper makes the first attempt (to the best of our knowledge) to provide a quantitative characteristic study of the current log messages within four pieces of large open-source software. First, we quantitatively show that software logging is pervasive. By examining developers' own modifications to the logging code in the revision history, we find that they often do not make the log messages right in their first attempts, and thus need to spend a significant amount of efforts to modify the log messages as after-thoughts. Our study further provides several interesting findings on where developers spend most of their efforts in modifying the log messages, which can give insights for programmers, tool developers, and language and compiler designers to improve the current logging practice. To demonstrate the benefit of our study, we built a simple checker based on one of our findings and effectively detected 138 pieces of new problematic logging code from studied software (24 of them are already confirmed and fixed by developers).

AB  - Network security has now become one of the most important aspects in computer systems and the Internet. Apart from strong encryption, there is no definite method of truly securing network, thus they must be protected at different levels of the OSI model. At the physical layer, they can be protected by lock-and-key, and at the data link, they can be protected within VLANS (virtual LANs). With the network and transport layers, networks can be secured by firewalls, which monitor source and destination network addresses, and source and destination ports, respectively. At the session level, user names and passwords are be used. Unfortunately, all these methods can be prone to methods which can overcome the protection used. This paper expands the research previously undertaken on a misuse system based on the intelligent agent software technology. The system monitors user actions in real-time and take appropriate actions if necessary. Along with this our system uses a short-term prediction to predict the user behaviour and advises the system administrator accordingly, before the actual actions take place. This paper presents new results, which are based on an increased number of users. We tested our short-term prediction model, introduced the notion of intervention to our model, and found that the results are very close to the actual user behaviour

AB  - One heuristic for data reduction that is widely used in the literature is coalescence of events occurring close in time. The authors explore the validity of this heuristic by developing a model for the formation of the contents of an event log by multiple independent error processes. The probability of coalescing events from two or more error sources is formulated and compared with results from hand analysis of actual event logs taken from a Tandem TNS II system. Results indicate that the probability of coalescing events from more than one error source is a strong function of the time constant selected. The model can be used to select an appropriate time constant and also has implications in designing event logging systems.<<ETX>>

AB  - The authors describe an implementation of an integrity-supporting discretionary access control mechanism-the capabilities knowledge base (CKB)-as an extension to the Clark and Wilson model (1987). They advocate using the audit trail to the fullest extent possible, not as just a passive collection of system events, but also as an active resource for solving the division-of-tasks problem that results from separation of duty. They emphasize that CKB can enforce the separation of duty as described in the Clark and Wilson model and therefore adds a measure of protection to information against unauthorized modification. This use of a knowledge base implementation is perceived as the only viable technical solution to the division-of-tasks problem. A high-level design for a CKB in support of data integrity is presented. The current implementation of CKB provides the functionality to import audit events and capability requests to the inferencing mechanism

AB  - Ideally, information systems security enables management to have confidence that their computational systems provide the information requested and expected, while denying accessibility to those who have no right to it. The analysis of incidents resulting in damage to information systems show that most losses were still due to errors or omissions by authorized users, actions of disgruntled employees, and an increase in external penetrations of systems by outsiders. Traditional controls are normally inadequate in these cases or are focused on the wrong threat, resulting in the exposure of vulnerability. Security is a critical parameter for the expansion and wide usage of agent technology. A threat model is constructed and subsequently the basic techniques to deal effectively with these threats are analyzed. This paper presents a dynamic, extensible, configurable and interoperable security architecture for mobile agent systems. It is explained how this architecture can be used to tackle a big part of security threats. All the components of the security architecture are analyzed while we also argue for the benefits they offer.

AB  - Syslog audit acts an important role in keeping host secure. This paper studied Host-based syslog, and constructed a secure state model for host performing normally from the angle of anomaly detection. Through deep research on syslog protocol, a log collection tool was created for collecting remote or local host syslog. Because different segments of syslog imply different system information, the model separated every segment from a syslog record with Regular Expression, then it made data preprocessing and statistic with rule matching, in the end it conducted analysis by BP (Back Propagation) NN (Neural Network). The result indicates that not only can it achieve Host-based intrusion and anomaly detection, but also it is a high efficient and intelligent method.

AB  - Evaluation is difficult but important part of learning to both teachers and students. This paper discusses the idea of using log systems to collect information in computer based education (CBE). The log information can be analyzed and used together or even instead of traditional evaluation measures. Furthermore, in terms of self-study CBE material, logging can be beneficially applied to interactively control learning. As a special case of interest, methods for using WWW log system in learning evaluation as well as advanced structures for interactive WWW-based education are discussed.

AB  - Because it is generally not possible to prevent the destruction or alteration of data when objects are stored or transmitted outside the security perimeter of a TCB (trusted computer base), the emphasis is placed on detecting any illicit data, including the results of computer viruses and Trojan Horse programs, using cryptographic checksums and digital signature techniques. It is concluded that a mandatory integrity policy consisting of the Biba hierarchical integrity policy extended to include integrity categories and multilevel integrity-trusted subjects, plus a discretionary integrity policy that uses a digital signature mechanism incorporated in a file label to indicate who created or produced that file, can provide integrity controls very well-suited to the networking environment

Particular focus is on how the system's hardware, microcode, and software are aimed at meeting A1-level security requirements while maintaining the standard interfaces and applications of the VMS and ULTRIX-32 operating systems. The VAX security kernel supports multiple concurrent virtual machines on a single VAX system, providing isolation and controlled sharing of sensitive data. Rigorous engineering standards were applied during development to comply with the assurance requirements for verification and configuration management. The VAX security kernel was developed with a heavy emphasis on performance and on system management tools. The kernel performs sufficiently well that all of its development can be now carried out in virtual machines running on the kernel itself, rather than in a conventional time-sharing system

AB  - DoD represents an environment of continuously changing mission requirements that requires our Information Systems to adapt to accomplish new tasks, quicker, in a more efficient manner. Agility is the only way we will be able to keep up with this change. But there are subtleties that must be considered as we adopt various agile methods: secure, protect, control and authenticate are all elements needed to posture our Information Technology systems to counteract the real and perceived threats in today's environment. Many systems have been tasked to ingest process and analyze different data sets than they were originally designed for and they have to interact with multiple new systems that were unaccounted for at design time. Leveraging the tenets of security, we have devised a new framework that takes agility into a new realm where the product will built to work in a service-based environment but is developed using agile processes. Even though these two criteria promise to hone the development effort, they actually contradict each other in philosophy where Services require stable interfaces, while Agile focuses on being flexible and tolerate changes up to much later stages of development. This framework is focused on enabling a successful product development that capitalizes on both philosophies.

AB  - In modern computer system, system logs are important for problem determination in troubleshooting. Especially in the troubleshooting of systems, system administrators need to understand overview of the problems and identify the root causes quickly, and system logs can help the system administrators. However large numbers of unfamiliar system logs when are generated problems occur, and it's difficult to understand and use them. Most of the existing methods for interpreting system logs don't work immediately and are not useful for troubleshooting situations. We have devised a new method for mining log formats and retrieving log types and parameters in incremental log messages. By creating a structured tree using the nodes generated from log messages, we created a method for mining and refining log format continuously in realtime. Our experiments shows that our method can identify the formats of real system logs without prior knowledge.

Emphasis is on software mechanisms which can be implemented on current computer systems. The approach is based on capabilities that limit the potential damage of undetected Trojan horses in development tools, and type managers that control access to software objects

AB  - The growing demand for processing and storage capabilities has led to the deployment of high-performance computing infrastructures. Users log into the computing infrastructure remotely, by providing their credentials (e.g., username and password), through the public network and using well-established authentication protocols, e.g., SSH. However, user credentials can be stolen and an attacker (using a stolen credential) can masquerade as the legitimate user and penetrate the system as an insider. This paper deals with security incidents initiated by using stolen credentials and occurred during the last three years at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. We analyze the key characteristics of the security data produced by the monitoring tools during the incidents and use a Bayesian network approach to correlate (i) data provided by different security tools (e.g., IDS and Net Flows) and (ii) information related to the users' profiles to identify compromised users, i.e., the users whose credentials have been stolen. The technique is validated with the real incident data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in detecting compromised users, while allows eliminating around 80% of false positives (i.e., not compromised user being declared compromised).

AB  - Although wireless sensor network is considered as one of promising technologies for ubiquitous computing environment, more researches for re-authentication of mobile nodes in wireless sensor network are required due to user mobility, one of important properties in ubiquitous computing environment. As the citizens in a city can be mobile user in wireless sensor network and the resource of the sensor nodes is limited, scalability of re-authentication is important. In other words, re-authentication with less communication cost should be proposed. In this paper, we suggest an efficient method of membership verification for re-authentication of mobile node and show the performance analysis of our membership verification. Using this method, we propose an efficient and scalable reauthentication protocol over wireless sensor network. Also, we provide performance and security analysis of our protocol.

AB  - Governments worldwide are enacting data protection laws that restrict the disclosure and processing of personal information. These laws impose administrative and financial burdens on companies that manage personal information and may hinder the legitimate and valuable sharing and analysis of this information. In this paper we describe an integrated set of technologies, known as the Hippocratic Database (HDB), which enables compliance with security and privacy regulations without impeding the legitimate flow of information. HDB's Control Center allows companies to specify fine-grained disclosure policies based on the role of the user, the purpose of the access, the intended recipient, and other disclosure conditions. Its Active Enforcement component transparently enforces these policies by transforming user queries in a middleware layer to ensure that the database returns only policy-compliant information. HDB's Compliance Auditing system efficiently tracks all database accesses and allows auditors to formulate precise audit queries to monitor compliance with privacy and security policies. In this paper, we outline the basic architecture of the HDB solution, discuss the advantages of our approach, and illustrate the features of each component with practical compliance scenarios from the financial services industry.

AB  - Today, the ability to investigate internal matters such as policy violations, regulatory compliance, and employee separation has become important in order for corporations to manage risk. The degree of information security threats evolving on a daily basis has increasingly raised concerns for enterprise organizations. These threats include but are not limited to fraud, insider threat and intellectual property (IP) theft. These have increased the demand for organizations to implement corporate forensics as a deterrent to illegitimate acts or for linking perpetrators to their illegitimate acts. This explains why forensic practices are expanding from the traditional role in law enforcement and becoming an essential part of business processes. However, most organizations may not be maximizing the benefits of corporate forensic capabilities because of lack of corporate forensic governance best practices, needed to ensure organizations prepare their operating environment for digital forensic investigation. Corporate forensic governance will help ensure that digital evidence is obtained in an efficient and effective way with minimal interruption to the business. This paper presents a corporate forensic governance framework intended to enhance forensic readiness, governance, and management, and increase the use of automated forensic techniques and in-house forensically sound practices in large organizations that have a need for these practices.

AB  - The authors have begun to address the problem of anonymized data with the development of a new prototype tool CANINE: Converter and ANonymizer for Investigating Netflow Events. Originally, just a NetFlow converter, CANINE has been adapted to anonymize 8 of the most common fields found in all NetFlow formats. Most of these fields can be anonymized in multiple ways providing trade-offs between security and utility. This is the first tool the authors are aware of that supports many levels of anonymization and is the only NetFlow anonymizer of which we are aware ?? besides a previous, less advanced tool they developed. This article is organized as follows. part 2 discusses related work in log anonymization. Part 3 discusses CANINE??s anonymization algorithms and design decisions in depth. Finally, part 4 concludes and presents future work on CANINE and the anonymization of other log types.

AB  - Over the last few years, cloud services have been steadily gaining traction in their use by commercial and noncommercial entities. As more and more sensitive or valuable processes, business functions and data move into the cloud, the need to improve threat identification and response, via auditing cloud transactions, increases. At the same time, the need for cloud users to protect the security and privacy of their resources has also intensified. In this paper, the problem of simultaneously supporting privacy and auditing in cloud systems is studied. Specifically, the paper discusses the guiding principles, fundamental concepts, and threat models for current cloud computing systems. Finally, we propose infrastructure that exploits a novel thin layer between the client and the cloud service provider to ensure that data storage, operation, and auditing does not reveal sensitive client information.

AB  - Authorization logics provide a principled and flexible approach to specifying access control policies. One of their compelling benefits is that a proof in the logic is evidence that an access-control decision has been made in accordance with policy. Using such proofs for auditing reduces the trusted computing base and enables the ability to detect flaws in complex authorization policies. Moreover, the proof structure is itself useful, because proof normalization can yield information about the relevance of policy statements. Untrusted, but well-typed, applications that access resources through an appropriate interface must obey the access control policy and create proofs useful for audit. This paper presents AURA_0, an authorization logic based on a dependently-typed variant of DCC and proves the metatheoretic properties of subject-reduction and normalization. It shows the utility of proof-based auditing in a number of examples and discusses several pragmatic issues that must be addressed in this context.

However, the nature of mobile devices brings additional issues that need to be considered, especially for when considering system security. This paper presents our initial work on the EU funded PEPERS project that seeks to support the development of secure mobile P2P applications. A core part of this support is with the design and development of a mobile P2P security platform.

AB  - Protecting implantable medical devices against attack without compromising patient health requires balancing security and privacy goals with traditional goals such as safety and utility. Implantable medical devices monitor and treat physiological conditions within the body. These devices - including pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs), drug delivery systems, and neurostimulators - can help manage a broad range of ailments, such as cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. IMDs' pervasiveness continues to swell, with upward of 25 million US citizens currently reliant on them for life-critical functions. Growth is spurred by geriatric care of the aging baby-boomer generation, and new therapies continually emerge for chronic conditions ranging from pediatric type 1 diabetes to anorgasmia and other sexual dysfunctions. Moreover, the latest IMDs support delivery of telemetry for remote monitoring over long-range, high-bandwidth wireless links, and emerging devices will communicate with other interoperating IMDs.

AB  - Most computers today are insecure because security is costly in terms of user inconvenience and foregone features, and people are unwilling to pay the price. Real-world security depends more on punishment than on locks, but it's hard to even find network attackers, much less punish them. The basic elements of security are authentication, authorization, and auditing: the gold standard. The idea of one principal speaking for another is the key to doing these uniformly across the Internet.

AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate the application of trusted computing to securing peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. We identify a central challenge in providing many of the security services within these networks, namely the absence of stable verifiable peer identities. We employ the functionalities provided by trusted computing technology to establish a pseudonymous authentication scheme for peers and extend this scheme to build secure channels between peers for future communications. In support of our work, we illustrate how commands from the trusted computing group (TCG) specifications can be used to implement our approach in P2P networks.

This vision was initially imagined as part of a research and development (R&amp;D) agenda sponsored by DARPA in 2002 in the form of the information awareness office (IAO) and the total information awareness (TIA) program. It includes a critical focus and commitment to delicately balancing national security objectives with privacy and civil liberties. We strongly believe that the two don't conflict and that the ultimate solution lies in utilizing information technologies for counterterrorism along with privacy-protection technologies to safeguard civil liberties, and twining them together with coordinated policies that bind them to their intended use

AB  - 802.11-based wireless networking has significantly altered the networking means and topology for cities, offices, homes and coffee shops over the last five years. A second generation of wireless devices has extended what was once a computer-to-computer protocol into the area of embedded functional devices. Accompanying this widespread usage is the presence of crime; the more popular technology, the more opportunity exists for its misuse. This work studies the 802.11-based wireless networking environment from a forensic computing perspective. It seeks to understand the current state of wireless misuse: present misuses; potential forms of misuse involving 802.11-based wireless networks; and current tools and techniques used in its identification, containment and analysis. The research highlights the lack of current tools and procedures for forensic computing investigations that are able to effectively handle the presence of wireless devices and networks, and that there are forms of misuse that may escape detection by forensic investigation teams.

The model can not only describe the users' behavioral profile more accurately, but also improve the accuracy of database anomalous detection. Based on the designed model, Apriori-kl algorithm, which combines the K-means clustering algorithm with the improved Apriori algorithm, is presented to mine users' behavior profile preferably so as to detect database anomaly more effectively and efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with the Apriori mining algorithm, Apriori-kl is superior in terms of time-consuming and detection accuracy.

AB  - Reliability is characteristic of the system which begins during the concept development phase of a product realization process and continuously or iteratively improved, until its end-of-life. Reliability data along with availability and serviceability (RAS) <sup>[1]</sup> can commonly be retrieved using the system logs through various data mining techniques. The size of the logs for a typical healthcare modality like the Philips Magnetic Resonance (MR) would be of the order of 3-digit megabyte number per day per installed base. Given the humongous size, various clustering techniques as used in big data processing algorithms <sup>[2]</sup>, grind the data to seek the correct results in a timely and efficient fashion. This post-processing step introduces a temporal shift in analyzing the data much after the events have occurred. For the state of affairs that affects reliability and serviceability, it is important that the condition of the deployed systems is notified to actors who can resolve such issues, meeting shrinking timelines demanded by the service level agreements. This would require the log information to be processed directly at the deployment without causing a system performance regression. This paper talks about such a technique that is implemented within the system purview to improve the lead time and thus increase efficiency of the feedback into the research and development (R &amp; D) department.

AB  - Intrusion detection is a new, retrofit approach for providing a sense of security in existing computers and data networks, while allowing them to operate in their current "open" mode. The goal of intrusion detection is to identify unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. The intrusion detection problem is becoming a challenging task due to the proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks since the increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders and makes it easier for intruders to avoid identification. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are based on the beliefs that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user and that many unauthorized actions are detectable. Typically, IDSs employ statistical anomaly and rulebased misuse models in order to detect intrusions. A number of prototype IDSs have been developed at several institutions, and some of them have also been deployed on an experimental basis in operational systems. In the present paper, several host-based and network-based IDSs are surveyed, and the characteristics of the corresponding systems are identified. The host-based systems employ the host operating system's audit trails as the main source of input to detect intrusive activity, while most of the network-based IDSs build their detection mechanism on monitored network traffic, and some employ host audit trails as well. An outline of a statistical anomaly detection algorithm employed in a typical IDS is also included.<<ETX>>

AB  - Much recent work has focused on the process of auditing the results of elections. Little work has focused on auditing the e-voting systems currently in use. The facilities for doing the former include the voter-verified paper audit trail; unfortunately, that VVPAT is not particularly helpful in tracking down the source of errors within e-voting systems. This paper discusses the need for a detailed forensic audit trail (FAT) to enable auditors to analyze the actions of e-voting systems, in order to demonstrate either the absence of problems or to find the causes of problems. We also discuss methods to prevent the use of the FAT as a covert channel for violating the necessary properties of secrecy of the ballot, so voters cannot sell their votes, and anonymity of the ballot, so a third party cannot associate a particular ballot with the voter who cast it.

AB  - A user's behaviour for using a specific web service on Internet, like her/his biometric information, can be used to identify the use. In many cases, the user behaviour represented as a set of attributes can be classified as either normal or anomalous. This value or in conjunction with other attributes of the user can be used to authorise the user of having access to the web service. To a certain extent, it can protect against identity theft since it may be very difficult to impersonate on behaviours of using Internet. This article presents how a user's behaviour for using a particular web service is observed and classified; how this behaviour attribute is securely transported across network; and how it used for access authorisation decision.

AB  - Botnet is a network of compromised computer that running malicious software remotely controlled by an attacker known as Botmaster. The threat of Botnet threaten is widely dangerous and it is crucially to overcome this crisis. Some new bots use P2P protocols to construct command and control system are known as peer-to-peer (P2P) Botnet. More severe when P2P Botnet incorporated the centralized and distributed communication which make it more robust and complicated for detection. Hence, the analysis is necessary to be conducted especially in the combination of host-based and network-based in order to detect bots accurately. This paper provides the details analysis on host-based analysis and network-based analysis to detect P2P bots that will reveal their unique characteristic and behaviors. The result of experimental testbed on datasets show that it is possible to detect effectively P2P Botnet in standalone host and network packet's payload. Thus, this analysis can be used for early warning of P2P Botnet activities in the host-and network-level as prevention mechanism.

AB  - A network providing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service requires many network elements. Each network element may have its own set of security capabilities, but not all security capabilities on all network elements are necessary at the same time for a given network configuration. An end-to-end network view is necessary to choose appropriate security capabilities while minimizing network overhead. For VoIP, using an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) core network and wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi<sup>&#x2217;</sup>) access, the service provider can offer the feature functionality of the core network to both enterprise and residential customers simultaneously. However, both market segments provide their own set of unique security challenges, and what is appropriate for one market segment is not necessarily appropriate for the other. This paper explores various security implications for both of these market segments and proposes options for securing each network configuration. Security aspects of the control plane, bearer plane, and management plane are considered. &#x00A9; 2007 Alcatel-Lucent.

AB  - Software-as-a-service (SaaS) provides developers a new convenient venue to distribute software by utilizing a cloud computing infrastructure. But as vendors start to deploy applications, and users upload data in cloud to utilize them, a new privacy concern arises, because data users would like to preserve their data (and maybe even their identities) private from the software provider. While cloud providers pledge to preserve data privacy, the current SaaS architecture makes it difficult to provide any assurance that the software in the cloud will not be able to make copies or redistribute the data it used. In this paper, we propose a new cloud based infrastructure which allows a clean differentiation between applications and data. We further utilize this differentiation to introduce the concept of trusted data binding, enforcing policy usage on application over data sets with the aid of trusted hardware such as the trusted platform module. We implemented our idea in a prototype system deployed in Amazon EC2, where software providers can upload software and data owners can search for algorithms to be executed privately on their data sets, with policy options such as a number of executions, data expiration and deletion, and encryption of data at rest. We believe that our contributions will be very beneficial for fields such as bioinformatics and software validation, were the software is executed against very sensitive data sets and require a high amount of computational resources.

AB  - SCADA and industrial control systems have been traditionally isolated in physically protected environments. However, developments such as standardisation of data exchange protocols and increased use of IP, emerging wireless sensor networks and machine-to-machine communication mean that in the near future related threat vectors will require consideration too outside the scope of traditional SCADA security and incident response. In the light of the significance of SCADA for the resilience of critical infrastructures and the related targeted incidents against them (e.g. the development of stuxnet), cyber security and digital forensics emerge as priority areas. In this paper we focus on the latter, exploring the current capability of SCADA operators to analyse security incidents and develop situational awareness based on a robust digital evidence perspective. We look at the logging capabilities of a typical SCADA architecture and the analytical techniques and investigative tools that may help develop forensic readiness to the level of the current threat environment requirements. We also provide recommendations for data capture and retention.

AB  - Peer-to-peer (P2P) mesh based streaming systems have gained widespread use for multicasting of audio and video. In approaches based on BitTorrent, members of the swarm share their content availability through gossiping, and redistribute file pieces cached locally. However, such systems are vulnerable to cheating attacks such as fake reporting, selective omission, fake block attack, and neighbor selection attack. These attacks will severely impact quality of service, waste resources, and discourage cooperation among participants. A defense mechanism, called AntiLiar, is proposed for defending against cheating attacks in mesh based streaming. AntiLiar uses a secure progress log that consists of commitments and one-time signatures, and maintains consistency for an expanded neighbor view. Experimental results demonstrate that AntiLiar minimizes required costs, and improves service quality over alternatives in the face of cheating attacks.

AB  - Video content analytics effectively identifies threats in video surveillance camera feeds. These behaviors include person/vehicle entering restricted zone, counter-flow detection, loitering, object left behind, and others. In order to provide enhanced security, events need to be integrated with a command and control system capable of effectively responding to hundreds of events per day in a busy, critical infrastructure facility. We describe a novel system -NerveCenter - that links analytic events with command center data wall camera pop-ups on alarm, extended notification tools that send multi-modal alerts, acknowledgement tracking, 911 computer aided dispatch (CAD), and geo-coded mapping tools that give operators a tactical map. The usability of these tools is discussed along with how to provide situational awareness and a common operating picture to operators and first responders.

In order to fully explore business opportunities provided by this paradigm, it is important to track its utilization. This can be done through the use of logging facilities. However, current Web logging approaches do not contemplate Web services utilization. This paper presents a Web services logging architecture based on SOAP intermediaries that captures comprehensive services usage information, which can be explored to improve B2B and B2C transactions by providing feedback on customer electronic behavior.

AB  - In SCN2010, Gagne, Narayan, and Safavi-Naini proposed attribute-based signcryption with threshold structure. As in cipher text-policy attribute-based encryption, a sender can specify the access structure of recipients, and as in attribute-based signature, each recipient can verify the sender's attributes. In contrast to the access structure of recipients, the access structure of the sender needs to be fixed in the setup phase. In this paper, we show that Gagne et al.'s threshold attribute-based signcryption is not secure and give a concrete forgery attack. The attack can make use some keys to construct any other legal keys and at last totally break the scheme. We also show that the attack is effective on other attribute-based cryptographic schemes with the same key structure.

The analysis of currently available computer architectures has shown that such systems offer a lot of security gaps. This is due to the fact that in the past hardware has only been optimized for speed - never for security. In this paper we propose a set of hardware features to support system security.

AB  - Alerts swamping and intrusion redundancy are two critical problems of intrusion detection technology that often worsen the problems of classification, data reduction, false positives, intrusion correlation and reporting. Consequently, the validity and continuous usage of intrusion detectors are constantly threatened because the system administrators are always helpless while trying to thwart attacks on computer infrastructure. Hence, this paper presents critically investigations of alert swamping and redundancy and how we have lessened them using a simple clustering method. Extensive evaluations that we performed on several synthetic and realistic datasets have significantly reduced these problems and have equally demonstrated the variability of these problems in each dataset. Also substantiated was a method that could help the system administrators to thwart attacks.

AB  - IT systems manage increasing amounts of sensitive data and there is a growing concern that they comply with policies that regulate data usage. In this paper, we use temporal logic to express policies and runtime monitoring to check system compliance. While well-established methods for monitoring linearly ordered system behavior exist, a major challenge is monitoring distributed and concurrent systems where actions are locally observed in the different system parts. These observations can only be partially ordered, while policy compliance may depend on the actions' actual order of appearance. Technically speaking, it is in general intractable to check compliance of partially ordered traces. We identify fragments of our policy specification language for which compliance can be checked efficiently, namely, by monitoring a single representative trace in which the observed actions are totally ordered. Through a case study we show that the fragments are capable of expressing nontrivial policies and that monitoring representative traces is feasible on real-world data.

AB  - Code injection attacks, despite being well researched, continue to be a problem today. Modern architectural solutions such as the execute-disable bit and PaX have been useful in limiting the attacks; however, they enforce program layout restrictions and can oftentimes still be circumvented by a determined attacker. We propose a change to the memory architecture of modern processors that addresses the code injection problem at its very root by virtually splitting memory into code memory and data memory such that a processor will never be able to fetch injected code for execution. This virtual split memory system can be implemented as a software-only patch to an operating system and can be used to supplement existing schemes for improved protection. Furthermore, our system is able to accommodate a number of response modes when a code injection attack occurs. Our experiments with both benchmarks and real-world attacks show the system is effective in preventing a wide range of code injection attacks while incurring reasonable overhead.

AB  - A number of detection and defense mechanisms have emerged in the last decade to tackle the botnet phenomenon. It is important to organize this knowledge to better understand the botnet problem and its solution space. In this paper, we structure existing botnet literature into three comprehensive taxonomies of botnet behavioral features, detection and defenses. This elevated view highlights opportunities for network defense by revealing shortcomings in existing approaches. We introduce the notion of a dimension to denote different criteria which can be used to classify botnet detection techniques. We demonstrate that classification by dimensions is particularly useful for evaluating botnet detection mechanisms through various metrics of interest. We also show how botnet behavioral features from the first taxonomy affect the accuracy of the detection approaches in the second taxonomy. This information can be used to devise integrated detection strategies by combining complementary approaches. To provide real-world context, we liberally augment our discussions with relevant examples from security research and products.

Our contributions are designed to better protect the patient's data and to increase the functionality and interoperability of smart cards in health care. Our solution, called SAMSON, consists of two types of smart cards. The first, a security card, is issued to all personnel within any medical organization, while the second, the medical card, is issued to patients and used to securely store and retrieve health care information. These smart cards are being tested within a 14 hospital federated consortium in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

AB  - Today's techniques for controlling access to software artifacts are limited to restricting access to whole files and directories. But when a company's access control policy does not match a project's existing physical modularization, these techniques require either an all-or-nothing approach or re-modularization of the files and directories. The increased maintenance overhead this brings to project administration can lead to unimplemented or insufficient developer access control and an increased risk of insider security incidents (e.g., theft of intellectual property). We have created a tool (GitBAC) to provide access control of software artifacts using a crosscutting concern instead of artifact modularization. Our method provides fine-grained access control of artifacts and accommodates flexible access control policies.

While there are frameworks in existence that addresses the technology aspects of these services, a holistic framework addressing processes, staffing and technology currently do not exist. Additionally, it would be useful for organizations and constituents considering building, buying or selling these services to measure the effectiveness and maturity of the provided services. In this paper, we propose a classification and rating scheme for SOC services, evaluating both the capabilities and the maturity of the services offered.

AB  - Masquerade attacks pose a serious threat for cloud system due to the massive amount of resource of these systems. Lack of datasets for cloud computing hinders the building of efficient intrusion detection of these attacks. Current dataset cannot be used due to the heterogeneity of user requirements, the distinct operating systems installed in the VMs, and the data size of Cloud systems. This paper presents a Cloud Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDD) that is the first one for cloud systems and that consists of both knowledge and behavior based audit data collected from both UNIX and Windows users. With respect to current datasets, CIDD has real instances of host and network based attacks and masquerades, and provides complete diverse audit parameters to build efficient detection techniques. The final statistic tables for each user are built by Log Analyzer and Correlator System (LACS) that parses and analyzes user's binary log files, and correlates audits data according to user IP address(es) and audit time. We describe in details the components and the architecture of LACS and CIDD, and the attacks distribution in CIDD.

AB  - This paper describes a framework for highly distributed real-time monitoring approach to database security using Intelligent multi-agents. The statistical anomaly prevention system employs back-propagation neural network forecasting model, which predicts unauthorized invasions of user based on previous observations and takes further action before intrusion occurs. Our back-propagation neural network model makes periodic short-term forecasts, since long-term forecasts cannot accurately predict an intrusion. We use a multivariate time series technique to forecast the hacker's behavior effectively. Our back-propagation neural network model results have been compared with traditional statistical forecasting models, and a better prediction accuracy has been observed. In order to reduce single point of failures in centralized security system, a dynamic distributed system has been designed in which the security management task is distributed across the network using Intelligent multi-agents.

AB  - In grid collaborations, scientists use middleware to execute computational experiments, visualize results, and securely share data on resources ranging from desktop machines to supercomputers. While there has been significant effort in authentication and authorization for these distributed infrastructures, it is still difficult to determine, post-facto, exactly what information might have been accessed, what operations might have occurred, and for what reasons. To address this problem, we have designed and implemented a secure logging infrastructure for grid data access. We uniquely leverage and extend XACML with new capabilities so that data owners can specify logging policies and these policies can be used to engage logging mechanisms to record events of interest to the data owners. A case study based on GridFTP.NET is presented and analyzed, utilizing both local storage of log records and remote storage via SAWS, an independently developed secure audit Web service. We show that with relatively little performance overhead, data owners are provided with new flexibility for determining the post-facto conditions under which their grid data was accessed

AB  - The growth of the Internet has been accompanied by the growth of Web services (e.g. e-commerce, e-health). This proliferation of Web services and the increasing regulatory and legal requirements for personal privacy have fueled the need to protect the personal privacy of Web service users. We advocate a privacy policy negotiation approach to protecting personal privacy (Yee and Korba, 2003; ). We provided semiautomated approaches for deriving personal privacy policies (Yee and Korba, 2004). However, it is evident that approaches are also needed to ensure that providers of Web services comply with the privacy policies of service users. In this paper, we examine privacy legislation to derive requirements for privacy policy compliance systems. We then propose an architecture for a privacy policy compliance system that satisfies the requirements and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed architecture.

AB  - The clustering approach forwarded by Klaus Julisch is considerably effectual in eliminating false positives and finding root causes among huge amount of security events. But the clustering problem was proved to be unfortunately an NP-hard one. In this paper, a GA-based algorithm is forwarded, which is much more effective than the original approximation algorithm by Julisch. The coding scheme and genetic operations including selection, crossover, and mutation are discussed in detail. To validate the quality of the newly-forwarded approach, a tree-version apriori is given, which is quite time-consuming but able to produce absolutely accurate solution used for comparison in a feasible period of time. The results show that the GA-based algorithm is valid and efficient and can find the optimal clusters that are very similar to the absolutely accurate ones

AB  - Since the need of the communication data in revealing the crime are just emerged after the event detected, communication data retention for lawful interception (LI) are really demanded. This paper aim to give recommendation for telecommunication regulatory body in making communication data retention regulation. This research describes points of recommendation to National Telecommunication Regulatory Body in establishing LI data retention regulation which conducted by the Communication Service Provider in the country. These recommendations are very useful for countries that do not have relevant regulations of this field. This paper suggests that propose data retention system must have an ability to run administrative function, data collection function and data management function. Each function should maintain such a log. Administrative log has to keep warrant information include target identity and date start, and the duration of data retention needed. In telecommunication infrastructure target are either MSISDN, IMEI or IMSI. For communication data through IP mechanism, target is either email address, account name or IP address. Information item that have to be retained are include subscriber data, usage data and traffic data, equipment data, network element data, additional service data and the call contents. If storage capacity are not fully provided yet, the retention for data that need the largest storage space such as video and file might be less priority. Regulatory Body must determine the data retention format based on handover interface. To prevent abuse of data, regulation should put clauses that obligate each party to delete data longer than retention period. Besides this paper recommends decentralize location of storage media, apart from operational system and have a hot site backup.

AB  - Policies show great potential as a way to control the behavior of complex computer systems. In the case of authorization decisions in large distributed systems, policies offer the potential to abstract away from the details of who is allowed to access which services, under which conditions. This layer of abstraction is both a challenge and an opportunity: policy-driven distributed authorization systems may be more manageable, scalable, available, and secure than previous approaches---or they may be just the opposite. In the talk that accompanies this paper paper, we survey the status of the field and its near- term prospects, from both a theoretical and a practical perspective, and point out the major barriers to the adoption of policy-driven authorization systems in industry.

AB  - Upon an intrusion, security staff must analyze the IT system that has been compromised, in order to determine how the attacker gained access to it, and what he did afterward. Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.

AB  - Cloud computing is an emerging data interactive paradigm to realize users' data remotely stored in an online cloud server. Cloud services provide great conveniences for the users to enjoy the on-demand cloud applications without considering the local infrastructure limitations. During the data accessing, different users may be in a collaborative relationship, and thus data sharing becomes significant to achieve productive benefits. The existing security solutions mainly focus on the authentication to realize that a user's privative data cannot be illegally accessed, but neglect a subtle privacy issue during a user challenging the cloud server to request other users for data sharing. The challenged access request itself may reveal the user's privacy no matter whether or not it can obtain the data access permissions. In this paper, we propose a shared authority based privacy-preserving authentication protocol (SAPA) to address above privacy issue for cloud storage. In the SAPA, 1) shared access authority is achieved by anonymous access request matching mechanism with security and privacy considerations (e.g., authentication, data anonymity, user privacy, and forward security); 2) attribute based access control is adopted to realize that the user can only access its own data fields; 3) proxy re-encryption is applied to provide data sharing among the multiple users. Meanwhile, universal composability (UC) model is established to prove that the SAPA theoretically has the design correctness. It indicates that the proposed protocol is attractive for multi-user collaborative cloud applications.

AB  - As it stands today, the Internet is not secure, so the only option is to understand how attacks occur and how best to protect against them. Ways to detect an intrusion and assess what the intruder did must be well thought out. For the most part, they will rely upon the ability of each system on the Internet to keep a log of events. The logs are invaluable for intrusion detection and analysis, indeed, they are basic to all postattack analysis. Authors of the security policy must determine what to log (keeping in mind how the desired level of logging will affect system performance) and how the logs should be analyzed. The logs should note who has entered the system as well as what they have done. Before a detailed examination is made of security methods, the issues affecting security enforcement are reviewed. The detection of intrusion using manual and automatic methods are discussed as are counterattack and damage assessment

But the mobile agent system will face some security threat since it will run in an opening network environment. In this paper, we analyzed the security threats in mobile agent system and provided a method to build the trusted connect between entities in mobile agent environment. This method uses the trusted platform module in trusted computing platform as the trusted base. When a mobile agent wants to migrate to another platform, it should use a trusted connect between the source host and the goal host. The agent and agent platform can trust with each other. This method will be helpful to build a trusted computing environment for the mobile agent system.

AB  - Modern industrial communication networks are increasingly based on open protocols and platforms that are also used in the office IT and Internet environment. This reuse facilitates development and deployment of highly connected systems, but also makes the communication system vulnerable to electronic attacks. This paper gives an overview of IT security issues in industrial automation systems which are based on open communication systems. First, security objectives, electronic attack methods, and the available countermeasures for general IT systems are described. General security objectives and best practices are listed. Particularly for the TCP/IP protocol suite, a wide range of cryptography-based secure communication protocols is available. The paper describes their principles and scope of application. Next, we focus on industrial communication systems, which have a number of security-relevant characteristics distinct from the office IT systems. Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control. The paper describes the status of relevant specifications and implementations for a number of standardized automation protocols. Finally, we illustrate the application of security concepts and tools by brief case studies describing security issues in the configuration and operation of substations, plants, or for remote access.

AB  - In order to solve security problems in web-based information systems in the large-scale distributed environment, we design a comprehensive security policy. We realize the single entry mechanism of multi-system access by using the single-sign-on, create identity authentication mechanism of high-reliability and security based on China's second-generation ID card. We also propose the cross-domain setup and its strategies for the access from scattered information systems. This paper will show the access control policy which combines dynamic and static methods, bring up a combination of coarse-grained and fine-grained access control strategy through refining digital objects, operations and rights. Besides we realize encrypted data communication for VPN by using SSL encryption technology to make data encapsulation. Considering the database security, we adopt access control technology, separation control technology, encryption technology, data flow control technology, reasoning control technology and backup technology. We then track and check all users who accessed or tried to access the system by using the system audit, use the triple-right separation mechanism for reliable management to avoid the abuse of powerful rights owned by the system administrator.

AB  - All computer systems are vulnerable to abuse and penetration by both legitimate users who abuse their authority and individuals who are not authorized to use the computer system. Many systems are under development to aid in the detection of these abuses. The capabilities of these `intrusion detection systems' (IDS) are varied, ranging from tools that provide for the meaningful reduction of audit data to tools that provide in-depth analysis of user and system behavior. The authors have performed a survey of the state-of-the-art in intrusion detection systems. This paper presents a summary of this survey

AB  - Secure role based messaging (SRBM) augments messaging systems with role oriented communication in a secure manner. Role occupants can sign and decrypt messages on behalf of roles. This paper identifies the requirements of SRBM and recognises the need for: distributed key shares, fast membership revocation, mandatory security controls and detection of identity spoofing. A shared RSA scheme is constructed. RSA keys are shared and distributed to role occupants and role gate keepers. Role occupants and role gate keepers must cooperate together to use the key shares to sign and decrypt the messages. Role occupant signatures can be verified by an audit service. SRBM system architecture is developed to show the security related performance of the proposed scheme, which also demonstrates the implementation of fast membership revocation, mandatory security control and prevention of spoofing. It is shown that the proposed scheme has successfully coupled distributed security with mandatory security controls to realize secure role based messaging.

AB  - As cyber-crimes using personal information such as ID theft are increasing, there is a need for appropriate technology or law to protect privacy. To this end, the Korean Government established the Privacy Act on March 29th 2011. The Privacy Act prescribes a specification for dealing with privacy with the intention to protect personal information from being collected, leaked, misused, or abused so that it can improve rights and interests of the nation and eventually realize the dignity and value of man. The United States, Japan, Canada, and several countries of the EU have their own privacy law being established or revised. Although there must be differences depending on the circumstances of each country, the ultimate goal of the privacy law should be the same. Consequently, there might be the same or similar technical protection required by all these countries. Between the increasing interest in protecting personal information and the establishment of the Privacy Act, many industries are having relevant products released one after another. Customers without knowledge of the law and the product types cannot decide what they need. This paper intends to derive necessary security functions of a personal information security system based on the Common Criteria and analyze the limit of the products in order to make guidelines for privacy and information protection system.

AB  - The paper presents a new approach to representing and detecting computer penetrations in real time. The approach, called state transition analysis, models penetrations as a series of state changes that lead from an initial secure state to a target compromised state. State transition diagrams, the graphical representation of penetrations, identify precisely the requirements for and the compromise of a penetration and present only the critical events that must occur for the successful completion of the penetration. State transition diagrams are written to correspond to the states of an actual computer system, and these diagrams form the basis of a rule based expert system for detecting penetrations, called the state transition analysis tool (STAT). The design and implementation of a Unix specific prototype of this expert system, called USTAT, is also presented. This prototype provides a further illustration of the overall design and functionality of this intrusion detection approach. Lastly, STAT is compared to the functionality of comparable intrusion detection tools

AB  - With the complexity posed by user account management for organizations, the need to implement an effective user account management process to help address possible risks to information cannot be overstated. To this end, this paper focuses on the development of a conceptual framework for enterprise user account lifecycle management (EUALMF), to help small - medium size organizations more effectively implement user account management recommendations contained in the NIST SP 800-53 standard, COBIT 4.1/5 framework, as well as other standards and best practices. It is argued that the high-level nature of the NIST standard and COBIT framework may make it difficult for small-medium size organizations to effectively implement recommendations proposed, due to resource and financial constraints. The framework is designed to provide a level of flexibility that ensures it can be easily adapted to most IT environments, to help ensure the separation of duties, least privilege and need-to-know principles are enforced, as well as providing the right balance between technical and non-technical controls to help prevent single-point-of-failure. The need to carry out a risk assessment process for user accounts, implementing an audit process, as well as implementing a performance measure metric has also been highlighted.

AB  - Security patterns can be a valuable vehicle to design secure software. Several proposals have been advanced to improve the usability of security patterns. They often describe extra annotations to be included in the pattern documentation. This paper presents an empirical study that validates whether those proposals provide any real benefit for software architects. A controlled experiment has been executed with 90 master students, who have performed several design tasks involving the hardening of a software architecture via security patterns. The results show that annotations produce benefits in terms of a reduced number of alternatives that need to be considered during the selection of a suitable pattern. However, they do not reduce the time spent in the selection process.

AB  - In this paper we present PasS (privacy as a service); a set of security protocols for ensuring the privacy and legal compliance of customer data in cloud computing architectures. PasS allows for the secure storage and processing of users' confidential data by leveraging the tamper-proof capabilities of cryptographic coprocessors. Using tamper-proof facilities provides a secure execution domain in the computing cloud that is physically and logically protected from unauthorized access. PasS central design goal is to maximize users' control in managing the various aspects related to the privacy of sensitive data. This is achieved by implementing user-configurable software protection and data privacy mechanisms. Moreover, PasS provides a privacy feedback process which informs users of the different privacy operations applied on their data and makes them aware of any potential risks that may jeopardize the confidentiality of their sensitive information. To the best of our knowledge, PasS is the first practical cloud computing privacy solution that utilizes previous research on cryptographic coprocessors to solve the problem of securely processing sensitive data in cloud computing infrastructures.

In this paper, we discuss the network forensics behaviors systematically from both the technical view and legal view. The goal of discussion is to outline the formalization and standardization of the network forensics behaviors. To our knowledge, this is the first time to comprehensively discuss the network forensics model and its fundamental fields, such as taxonomy, conceptual model, legal principles, key techniques, canonical processes and its accessory facilities and systems - network forensics system architecture and deployment. These discussions will give the guidance to the standardization of network forensics processes and the implementation of prototype system.

AB  - With the ever advancing technology of fast information processing, protecting data with only access control mechanisms is becoming increasingly difficult. If someone breaks into a database, the entire data will be compromised if it is in plaintext form. One quick remedy is to keep the data in encrypted form. However, encryption will make it difficult to do any operations on the data. This has prompted considerable research in the last decade and has led to various schemes of searchable encryption. It allows search over the encrypted data. There are various techniques which support different levels of querying, making it suitable for variety of applications. However, almost all of them are either symmetric-key or single-user schemes or require key sharing. Here, we are proposing a new scheme which will allow multiple users to encrypt, store and decrypt their own data, along with support for doing data searches over all the data by other users.

AB  - Intrusion detection systems overload their human operators by triggering thousands of alarms per day, most of which are false positives. A clustering method, put forward by Claus Julisch, is very effective in eliminating false positives and finding the root causes. However, according to the variance related to the operators' knowledge and experience, a gap may exist between the nature of the event clusters and what the operators obtained from the resulting clusters. A subjective distance, different from the objective distance defined by Julisch, is proposed to fill the gap by controlling the clustering process with the subjective distance.

AB  - Intrusion detection systems generally overload their human operators by triggering per day thousands of alarms most of which are false positives. A clustering method able to eliminate most false positives was put forward by Klaus Julisch, who proved that the clustering problem is NP-complete and proposed a low-quality approximation algorithm. In this paper, the simulated annealing technique is applied in the clustering procedure, to produce high-quality solutions. The local optimization strategy, cooling schedule, and evaluation function are discussed in details. A state-of-the-art selection table is proposed, which greatly reduces the evaluation operation. In order to validate the newly proposed algorithm, a kind of exhaustive searching is implemented, which can find global minima for comparison with the cost of long yet feasible execution time. The results show that the SA-based clustering algorithm can produce solutions with the quality very close to that of the best one, whilst the time consumption is within a reasonable range.

New security concerns arise in transmitting and processing of electronic medical records, personal healthcare records, patient billing records, as well as public health alerts, across many parties with varying security, privacy and trust levels. Additional security requirements in e-Healthcare settings have to be formulated beyond traditional data networking services. Our results include an e-Healthcare security solution framework that enables multi-party participation, allows variable visibility into selective parts of data, and guarantees end-to-end security control.

AB  - An effective method for detecting computer misuse is the automatic auditing and analysis of on-line user activity. This activity is reflected in the system audit record, by changes in the vulnerability posture of the system configuration, and in other evidence found through active testing of the system. In 1989 we started developing an automatic misuse detection system for the Integrated Computing Network (ICN) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Since 1990 this system has been operational, monitoring a variety of network systems and services. We call it the Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Reporter, or NADIR. During the last year and a half, we expanded NADIR to include processing of audit and activity records for the Cray UNICOS operating system. This new component is called the UNICOS Real-time NADIR, or UNICORN. UNICORN summarizes user activity and system configuration information in statistical profiles. In near real-time, it can compare current activity to historical profiles and test activity against expert rules that express our security policy and define improper or suspicious behavior. It reports suspicious behavior to security auditors and provides tools to aid in follow-up investigations. UNICORN is currently operational on four Crays in Los Alamos' main computing network, the ICN.

AB  - Security-enhanced Linux offers a robust mandatory access control protection scheme that enhances standard Unix-based permissions, and allows for greater overall system security. While a wide array of configuration tools are currently available, system administration of SELinux is still cumbersome. One area that could ease some of the configuration burdens is kernel event logging, specifically for security-enhanced Linux generated events. This paper proposes a tool, called SILT, designed to enhance SELinux logging. A flexible interface supports command-line and graphical logging configuration. Backend scripts tune the logging facility, according to user direction.

AB  - Grid portals are an increasingly popular mechanism for creating customizable, Web-based interfaces to grid services and resources. Due to the powerful, general-purpose nature of grid technology, the security of any portal or entry point to such resources cannot be taken lightly. This is particularly true if the portal is running inside of a trusted perimeter, such as a science gateway running on an SDSC machine for access to the TeraGrid. To evaluate the current state of grid portal security, we undertake a comparative analysis of the three most popular grid portal frameworks that are being pursued as frontends to the TeraGrid: GridSphere, OGCE and clarens. We explore general challenges that grid portals face in the areas of authentication (including user identification), authorization, auditing (logging) and session management then contrast how the different grid portal implementations address these challenges. We find that although most grid portals address these security concerns to a certain extent, there is still room for improvement, particularly in the areas of secure default configurations and comprehensive logging and auditing support. We conclude with specific recommendations for designing, implementing and configuring secure grid portals

AB  - The current state of affairs regarding the way events are logged by IT systems is the source of many problems for the developers of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. These problems stand in the way of the development of more accurate security solutions that draw their results from the data included within the logs they process. This is mainly caused by a lack of standards that can encapsulate all events in a coherent way. As a result, correlating between logs produced by different systems that use different log formats has been difficult and infeasible in many cases. In order to solve the challenges faced by Correlation Based Intrusion Detection Systems, we provide a platform for normalising events1 into a unified super event loosely based on the Common Event Expression standard (CEE) developed by the Mitre corporation. We show how our solution is able to normalise seemingly unrelated events into a unified format. Additionally, we demonstrate queries that can detect attacks on collections of normalised logs from different sources.

With the frequent use of internet technology, Cyber crime became the new threat of our society. Amongst all advance technology, wireless network is the number one threat, with high mobility, no wired required and easy installation, it's the most common way to access the internet these days. Wireless signals travels through air rather than a traditional wired network which can be much more vulnerable for those who has intentions pursuing illegal activities. With the increases growth of internet users and the development of new technologies, current legislations and security has faced difficulties in trying to keep up, hence Cyber crime numbers are increased rapidly. Although wireless Cyber crime is a new threat, but with the detail tracking and investigation effort, ultimately the professional will find some kind of digital evidence, and its often required to identify and preserve in order to be recognized and restoring the truth, hence the establishment of trainings in digital evidence through to forensic requires immediate implementation, with increase of the standards and knowledge it will strength the competence and credibility of the forensics unit's professional ability in assistance to fight again all crime.

AB  - In a distributed multi-user environment, the security policy must not only specify legitimate user privileges but also aid in the detection of the abuse of the privileges and adapt to perceived system threat conditions. This paper advocates extending authorization policy evaluation mechanisms with a means for generating audit data allowing immediate notification of suspicious application level activity. It additionally suggests that the evaluation of the policies themselves adapt to perceived network threat conditions, possibly affected by the receipt of such audit data by other processes. Such advanced policies assist in detecting and responding to intrusion and misuse and they allow more efficient utilization of security services, such as authentication, audit, and notification. We present an authorization framework, which enables the representation and enforcement of advanced security policies. Our approach is based on expanding the policy evaluation mechanism with the ability to generate real time actions, such as checking the current system threat level and sending a notification.

AB  - Computer network defense (CND) capabilities are designed for business efficiency in a static, stable network environment, where network assets are known and the mission of the network rarely varies. Such capabilities do not consider mission needs when identifying and compensating for attacks on assets critical to the current mission. Security awareness remains the same whether the network is carrying redundant inventory data or supporting critical operations. Advanced attackers who may already know the network details, its systems and software, and any mission objectives therefore already have an advantage. We propose a three-step process to enable migration from the current CND strategy toward one of mission network defense. This transition would lead to better, more adaptable security capabilities by encouraging exchange of mission-related event information. By adopting and extending the Common Event Expression standard to support mission-relevant data, CND systems can begin to monitor their mission environment. Once standardized mission event information becomes available, we can concentrate on developing more adaptive CND capabilities that are better suited to the various mission environments.

AB  - Remote voting through the Internet provides convenience and access to the electorate. At the same time, the security concerns facing any distributed application are magnified when the task is so crucial to democratic society. In addition, some of the electoral process loses transparency when it is encapsulated in information technology. In this paper, we examine the public record of three recent elections that used Internet voting. Our specific goal is to identify any potential flaws that security experts would recognize, but that may have not been identified in the rush to implement technology. To do this, we present a multiple exploratory case study, looking at elections conducted between 2006 and 2007 in Estonia, The Netherlands, and Switzerland. These elections were selected as particularly interesting and accessible, and each presents its own technical and security challenges. The electoral environment, technical design, and process for each election are described, including reconstruction of details which are implied but not specified within the source material. We found that all three elections warrant significant concern about voter security, verifiability, and transparency. Usability, our fourth area of focus, seems to have been well-addressed in these elections. While our analysis is based on public documents and previously published reports, therefore lacking access to any confidential materials held by electoral officials, this comparative analysis provides interesting insight and consistent questions across all these cases. Effective review of Internet voting requires an aggressive stance towards identifying potential security and operational flaws, and we encourage the use of third-party reviews with critical technology skills during design, programming, and voting to reduce the changes of failure or fraud that would undermine public confidence.

AB  - In regulated domains such as finance and health care, failure to comply with regulation can lead to financial, civil and criminal penalties. While systems vary from organization to organization, the same regulations apply for all systems. As a result, efficiencies could be gained if the commonalities between systems could be captured in public, shared, test suites for regulations. We propose the use of Behavior-Driven-Development (BDD) technology to create these test suites. With BDD, desired system behavior with respect to regulatory requirements can be captured as constrained natural language 'scenarios'. The scenarios can then be automated through system-specific test drivers. The goal of this research is to enable organizations to compare their systems to regulation in a repeatable and traceable way through the use of BDD. To evaluate our approach, we developed seven scenarios based on the HITECH Act Meaningful Use (MU) regulations for healthcare. We then created system-specific code for three open-source electronic health record systems. We found that it was possible to create scenarios and system-specific code supporting scenario execution on three systems, that iTrust can be shown to be noncompliant, and that emergency access procedures are not defined clearly enough by the regulation to determine compliance or non-compliance.

AB  - This paper presents performance metrics to be used for evaluation of cyber dynamic defense solutions. Currently, there are no standard, industry-defined metrics or benchmarks for evaluating cyber security architectures and systems for dynamic defense. These systems have relied instead on a layered, &#x201C;defense in depth&#x201D; approach, where the only measurement made is the number of defenses. In order to characterize the performance of cyber defense solutions, a variety of metrics need to be defined and captured based on observable effects on both cyber attacks and defenses. By establishing these metrics, the benefit each individual layer provides to an overall defensive solution can be determined, allowing system designers to select the most effective suite of defensive techniques. The metrics presented were formulated using a discrete event simulation of dynamic defense solutions. The focus of this simulation was to assess the increased cost to cyber attackers, where cost is based in time. Metrics are captured from the perspective of the defender, as well as that of the attacker. Collection of data supporting computation of the metrics will be shown in a discrete event simulation environment, as well as recommendations for network locations and equipment that can be used to collect these metrics in a notional network architecture.

AB  - The traceback problem is one of the hardest in information security and has always been the utmost solution to holding attackers accountable for their actions. This paper presents a brief overview of the traceback problem, while discussing the features of software, network and computer forensics. In the rest of this paper, various traceback mechanisms are examined while categorized according to their features and modes of operation. Finally, we propose a classification schema for all traceback methods in order to assess and combine their benefits so as to provide enough information for digital forensics analyses, thus getting -the right way- one step closer to the actual attacker.

AB  - The Information communication Technologies (ICT) has assumed an important role in all domains of life today. The computation requirements are often larger than resources available at hand in an enterprise and it would like to outsource it for high speed computation or data management requirements. In other cases a small enterprise would like to lease computation or data archiving resources as per demand. Cloud computing is a new paradigm which may be used to handle such situations. It offers a virtual environment at a small initial investment by entrepreneurs planning to develop large applications scalable as the scope and workload increases. The computer hardware and software are available in virtualized environments of cloud computing offering Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS) through Datacenters and Cloud Service Providers (CSP). The paradigm shift provides elastic infrastructure, efficiency of resource utilization, reduction in upfront capital investment and focus on core activities. A model for cloud computing for telemedic services is being developed to cater for large data archive of Clinical Data Records (CDR), Decision Support Systems (DSS) and event based notification and monitoring system in a typical hospital. In this paper we have reviewed the rapid growth in cloud computing activities, available opportunities and services with the early birds in this technology. Beside this the hospital information and medical data services architecture using cloud services has been discussed in the context of the model being developed. Data storage service, Security service, scalability and performance issues have been discussed.

AB  - Cyber weapons are becoming autonomous intelligent agents with considerable autonomy and planning ability. The examples of this kind of weapons already exist and have been used. This makes situation awareness a key factor of safety of cyber weapons. There are risks of wrong behavior of such weapons caused by the following two factors: misunderstanding of commands, misinterpretation of situation. The present paper analyses some known cases of misbehavior of cyber weapons and predicts the future threats of this kind. The more intelligent software becomes the more difficult will be to control it. When designing and developing new cyber weapons, one has to pay special attention to supporting situation awareness of the weapons and keeping appropriate control over the weapons under any circumstances.

AB  - In most of the current authorization frameworks in applications systems, the authorization for a user operation is determined using a static database like ACL entries or system tables. These frameworks cannot provide the foundation for supporting multiple types of authorizations like emergency authorizations, context-based authorizations etc., which are required in many vertical market systems like healthcare application systems. We describe a dynamic authorization framework which supports multiple authorization types. We use the acronym DAFMAT (Dynamic Authorization Framework for Multiple Authorization Types) to refer to this framework. The DAFMAT framework uses a combination of role-based access control (RBAC) and dynamic type enforcement (DTE) augmented with a logic-driven authorization engine. The application of DAFMAT for evaluating and determining various types of authorization requests for the Admissions Discharge and Transfer System (ADT) in a healthcare enterprise is described.

AB  - Cloud computing is the promising model of delivering IT resources on demand. Identity and Access Management (IAM) stands as the hurdle for enterprises to adopt to cloud. This paper discusses IAM component of Security as a Service (SecaaS) in the context of cloud computing with a Trust Agent. We have proposed user-centric trust agent identity service which is aimed to create trust among the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) in the federated environment. Relevant standards such as SAML, SPML, XACML, and OAuth are discussed to enable trusted and secure access to cloud services.

AB  - One of the most strategic component for an efficient and effective emergency management is the availability of an infrastructure on support of information sharing. Indeed, during emergency situations it is vital that the necessary information timely reaches the right person. Even if emergency management usually requires to bypass access control policies in place during the system normal operations, it is crucial that such process is temporary and controlled by proper emergency policies. To cope with these requirements, in this paper we present a system able to: 1) detect the events that cause the triggering of an emergency policy, 2) make immediately available to the authorized subjects information covered by the emergency policy. This is achieved by the definition of flexible emergency policies and by the use of a Complex Event Processing system on support of event monitoring and policy triggering. The paper also presents preliminary experiments on system overhead.

AB  - Frequent failures are becoming a serious concern to the community of high-end computing, especially when the applications and the underlying systems rapidly grow in size and complexity. In order to develop effective fault-tolerant strategies, there is a critical need to predict failure events. To this end, we have collected detailed event logs from IBM BlueGene/L, which has 128 K processors, and is currently the fastest supercomputer in the world. In this study, we first show how the event records can be converted into a data set that is appropriate for running classification techniques. Then we apply classifiers on the data, including RIPPER (a rule-based classifier), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a traditional Nearest Neighbor method, and a customized Nearest Neighbor method. We show that the customized nearest neighbor approach can outperform RIPPER and SVMs in terms of both coverage and precision. The results suggest that the customized nearest neighbor approach can be used to alleviate the impact of failures.

With this in mind, the author identifies metrics designed to mitigate vulnerabilities to cyberattacks in networks that are key to the critical infrastructure of the US. He discusses both growth metrics - based on data obtained from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and Department of Homeland Security vulnerability database - and metrics designed to mitigate the risk of security vulnerabilities in networks. If used together, these two types of metrics can help make networks more secure.

AB  - The growing computational and storage needs of several scientific applications mandate the deployment of extreme-scale parallel machines, such as IBM's BlueGene/L, which can accommodate as many as 128K processors. In this paper, we present our experiences in collecting and filtering error event logs from a 8192 processor BlueGene/L prototype at IBM Rochester, which is currently ranked #8 in the Top-500 list. We analyze the logs collected from this machine over a period of 84 days starting from August 26, 2004. We perform a three-step filtering algorithm on these logs: extracting and categorizing failure events; temporal filtering to remove duplicate reports from the same location; and finally coalescing failure reports of the same error across different locations. Using this approach, we can substantially compress these logs, removing over 99.96% of the 828,387 original entries, and more accurately portray the failure occurrences on this system.

AB  - This paper presents a measurement-based dependability study of a Networked Windows NT system based on field data collected from NT System Logs from 503 servers running in a production environment over a four-month period. The event logs at hand contains only system reboot information. We study individual server failures and domain behavior in order to characterize failure behavior and explore error propagation between servers. The key observations from this study are: (1) system software and hardware failures are the two major contributors to the total system downtime (22% and 10%), (2) recovery from application software failures are usually quick, (3) in many cases, more than one reboots are required to recover from a failure, (4) the average availability of an individual server is over 99%, (5) there is a strong indication of error dependency or error propagation across the network, (6) most (58%) reboots are unclassified indicating the need for better logging techniques, (7) maintenance and configuration contribute to 24% of system downtime

AB  - Logs are one of the most fundamental resources to any security professional. It is widely recognized by the government and industry that it is both beneficial and desirable to share logs for the purpose of security research. However, the sharing is not happening or not to the degree or magnitude that is desired. Organizations are reluctant to share logs because of the risk from exposing sensitive information to potential attackers. In this paper we survey current attempts at sharing logs and current log anonymization tools. We further define the problem and describe a roadmap to solve the issues that have to date inhibited large scale log sharing.

AB  - Regimen adherence is a key factor in the success of home monitoring of lung transplant recipients. Patients generally adhere satisfactorily with home spirometry in the short-term, but adherence tends to decline over time. Telehealth and Internet technology provide new methods to address this issue. The unique contribution of the Adherence Enhancement Internet Program (AEIP) is the integration of multiple adherence enhancement strategies operating in a unified approach to the adherence problem, while meshing all user groups to facilitate interactions. This Internet-based program focused on promoting subject specific strategies was developed to maintain the initial high levels of adherence beyond the first year post transplant. The program provides more immediate subject feedback related to home monitoring data, reminders from the patient's health care providers, educational material, and guidance in dealing with subject specific barriers to maintaining adherence. It also simplifies communication between patients and health care providers, and supports providers in certain patient care tasks. A feasibility trial involving 12 lung transplant recipients demonstrated that subjects were able to use the AEIP with little training, found it acceptable, and were generally enthusiastic regarding it as a tool to maintain or enhance adherence

In this paper, we propose and implement an intrusion detection system (IDS) based on SSFNet simulation framework. IDS is one of core elements in the cyber intrusions. Proposed IDS system has a rule-based type with misuse detect. Performing various types of simulations for network intrusions, the implemented IDS on the simulation shows that it plays the same property as that of actual networks.

AB  - The growth of the Internet has been accompanied by the growth of e-services (e.g. e-commerce, e-health). This proliferation of e-services and the increasing regulatory and legal requirements for personal privacy have fueled the need to protect the personal privacy of e-service users. Approaches are needed to ensure that providers of e-services comply with the privacy policies of service users. In this paper, we examine privacy legislation to derive requirements for privacy policy compliance systems. We then propose an agent-based architecture for a privacy policy compliance system that satisfies many of the requirements and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed architecture.

AB  - The Sarbanes-Oxley Act instituted a series of corporate reforms to improve the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting. Sections 302 and 404 of the Act require SEC-reporting companies to implement internal controls over financial reporting, periodically assess the effectiveness of these internal controls, and certify the accuracy of their financial statements. We suggest that database technology can play an important role in assisting compliance with the internal control provisions of the Act. The core components of our solution include: (i) modeling of required workflows, (ii) active enforcement of control activities, (iii) auditing of actual workflows to verify compliance with internal controls, and (iv) discovery-driven OLAP to identify irregularities in financial data. We illustrate how the features of our solution fulfill Sarbanes-Oxley requirements using several real-life scenarios. In the process, we identify opportunities for new database research.

AB  - The goal of service provider federations is to support a controlled method by which distributed organizations can provide services to qualified individuals and manage their identity attributes at an inter-organizational level. In order to make access control decisions the history of activities should be accounted for, therefore it is necessary to record information on interactions among the federation entities. To achieve these goals we propose a comprehensive assertion language able to support description of static and dynamic properties of the federation system. The assertions are a powerful means to describe the behavior of the entities interacting in the federation, and to define policies controlling access to services and privacy policies. We also propose a log-based approach for capturing the history of activities within the federation implemented as a set of tables stored at databases at the various organizations in the federation. We illustrate how, by using different types of queries on such tables, security properties of the federation can be verified

AB  - Computer security breaches are already a major problem in using computers. The most basic defense against it is to monitor and audit the computer logs. Computer logs, however have a huge amount of textual data. It is, therefore, almost impossible to inspect them manually using current systems. We propose a log visualization system called "Tudumi". Tudumi consists of several functions which assist system administrators to perform such tasks manually. These functions are information visualization, log summarization and reflecting known rules into the visualization method. Tudumi makes it easier to detect anomalous user activities, such as intrusion, from a huge amount of computer logs.

AB  - Security in today's government and commercial environments is changing. The willingness to provide manpower against security threats is diminishing. Risk management is preferred to risk avoidance. In order for management to ensure that the appropriate security is provided while downsizing or right sizing protective services and other security personnel, automation of security technologies is a necessity. Several manpower intensive tasks and processes are: facilities access control, issuance of staff and visitor badges, provision of information for visitors, access control to interior facilities, and the issuance of office keys. Reduction of the required manning for these processes is enabled though the automation and integration of various security technologies including biometric identification systems. This paper provides a background on manpower intensive tasks and processes, security technologies that may be employed within them, resource reduction capabilities, and a customer's experience with the use of the technologies within a large Government environment

AB  - A firewall is a security device placed between a private network and a public network such as the Internet. It is designed to protect the private network resources from unauthorized user access. Today, various firewalls are widely used in many places (e.g., Internet data centers, company headquarters, branch office, telecommuters' homes). What is desperately needed is a management system that can easily configure, monitor and manage multi-site deployed firewalls from a central location. For flexibility, such a management system must be divided into components and needs to use an open management protocol, such as the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Yet the SNMP has a security defect. Further, the proposed standard Management Information Base (MIB) for firewalls is insufficient for supporting centralized global management of a lot of firewall devices. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a secure Web and SNMP-based global firewall management system. We have focused on two aspects: 1) extending the existing proposed standard MIB to support the configuration and monitoring of hundreds or thousands of firewall and VPN devices; 2) providing secure communication among global manager system components in order to provide secure firewall management. We also present our work on developing our firewall global manager (FGM) on commercial firewall/VPN devices.

AB  - We propose an efficient and flexible system for a secure and authentic data exchange in a multiinstitutional environment, where the institutions maintain different databases and provide secure and limited access services to employees of other institutions. The main motivation for building such a system was to organize efficient cooperative use of state registers, in order to increase the efficiency and quality of public services in Estonia. In order to meet high security requirements, several contemporary measures are integrated (using digital signatures, distributing certificate information by means of DNS protocol and linking log files with cryptographic checksums). We give rationale for the design decisions made in the implementation process and conclude with the current state of public use of the resulting infrastructure.

AB  - A law now in effect in the United States requires protection of individual privacy in computerized personal information record-keeping systems maintained by the federal government. Similar laws apply in certain state and local governments. Legislation has also been introduced to extend the requirements for privacy protection to the private sphere. Central in privacy protection are the rights of an individual to know what data are maintained on him, challenge their veracity and relevance, limit their nonroutine use or dissemination, and be assured that their quality, integrity, and confidentiality are maintained. In all computer systems that maintain and process valuable information, or provide services to multiple users concurrently, it is necessary to provide security safeguards against unauthorized access, use, or modifications of any data file. This difficult problem has not yet been solved in the general case. Computer systems must also be protected against unauthorized use, disruption of operations, and physical damage. The growing number of computer applications involving valuable information or assets plus the growing number of criminal actions directed against computer applications and systems or perpetrated by using computers underscore the need for finding effective solutions to the computer security problem. In the future, concerns for privacy and security must become integral in the planning and design of computer systems and their applications.

AB  - This paper presents an approach to assess security of Web servers. This method can be used to compare the security features of different Web servers installations and to determine how secure a given Web server configuration is. The assessment is done by applying a set of tests designed to check if the system under evaluation fulfils a set of security practices defined by an extensive field study. This work targets the most typical issues related to Web servers ranging from classic Web servers misconfiguration to the absence of a secure network infrastructure and of well-defined security policies to respond to security incidents. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated through the security assessment and comparison of five different real Web servers.

Issues related to integrating laws and recommendation for e-voting systems, managing different elections and configurations, supporting a spiral development, yielded problems and approaches to help maintain integrity of requirements and a coherent view of the system. Moreover, the relationship between requirements and system architecture is based on finite state machines, that bridge the gap between the laws and the actual behavior of the machine.

AB  - A data center is an infrastructure that supports Internet service. Cloud computing is rapidly changing the face of the Internet service infrastructure, enabling even small organizations to quickly build Web and mobile applications for millions of users by taking advantage of the scale and flexibility of shared physical infrastructures provided by cloud computing. In this scenario, multiple tenants save their data and applications in shared data centers, blurring the network boundaries between each tenant in the cloud. In addition, different tenants have different security requirements, while different security policies are necessary for different tenants. Network virtualization is used to meet a diverse set of tenant-specific requirements with the underlying physical network, enabling multi-tenant datacenters to automatically address a large and diverse set of tenants requirements. In this paper, we propose the system implementation of vCNSMS, a collaborative network security prototype system used in a multi-tenant data center. We demonstrate vCNSMS with a centralized collaborative scheme and deep packet inspection with an open source UTM system. A security level based protection policy is proposed for simplifying the security rule management for vCNSMS. Different security levels have different packet inspection schemes and are enforced with different security plugins. A smart packet verdict scheme is also integrated into vCNSMS for intelligence flow processing to protect from possible network attacks inside a data center network.

AB  - Clinics in developing nations often use paper-based records that are hard to manage or are inefficient. Electronic medical records (EMR) systems could help increase the efficiency and efficacy of these clinics. Even though some EMR systems have been developed for developing countries, they lack customizability. This paper gives some background information about EMR systems: how they are used in developed countries, and how FileMaker, an off-the-shelf database software, could be used to rapidly deploy EMR systems in clinics and hospitals of developing countries. An existing EMR database developed by Banner Alzheimer's Institute serves as a proof of concept that FileMaker is a viable EMR solution.

AB  - As security monitoring grows both more complicated and more sophisticated, there is an increased demand for outsourcing these tasks to managed security service providers (MSSPs). However, the core problem of sharing private security logs creates a barrier to the widespread adoption of this business model. In this paper we analyze the logs used for security analysis with the concern of privacy and propose the constraints on anonymization of security monitor logs. We believe if the anonymization solution fulfills the constraints, MSSPs can detect the attacks efficiently and protect privacy simultaneously

AB  - Trusted Mach (TMach) is a message-passing, server-oriented system being targeted at the B3 level of the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC). The authors present a rationale for why these characteristics, and the TMach architecture that implements and embodies them, are compatible with B3 requirements. It is shown that the TMach TCB (trusted computer base), composed of a kernel (which implements basic system abstractions and mediates their access) and a collection of trusted servers, is structured to provide conceptually simple protection mechanisms. Least privilege and modularity are central to the server-oriented design of the system. Easy extensibility of the TMach TCB to provide trusted applications is an added benefit of the system structure

AB  - Because it is impossible to find attacker's real IP address in hacking attacks against Korean users from other countries although the tracking method is used, investigators thereof have great difficulty. This is because attackers use the IP spoofing method to conceal their IP address while they go through a plurality of proxy servers. This study aims to examine how attackers use the IP spoofing method, and apply the proxy servers to attempt attacks. This study suggests a method of defending users against IP spoofing attacks through proxy servers, and a method of IP traceback, and will contribute to technical development for global hacking and security defense technology.

AB  - Network Maneuver Commander (NMC) is a research project to develop a prototype cyber command and control (C2) system that maneuvers network-based elements preemptively, and to develop performance metrics to be used for the evaluation of cyber dynamic defense solutions. The Network Maneuver Commander addresses the gap area between active information operations &amp; reactive information assurance defenses, by focusing on the introduction of artificial diversity of hardware platforms, operating systems, IP addresses and hypervisors. NMC also establishes metrics to determine the benefit of these defensive techniques. The goals of the research were to increase the investment an attacker must make to succeed, increase the exposure of an attacker to detection as the attacker is forced to out-maneuver target reconfigurations, increase the uncertainty of the success of the attack, increase the survivability in the presence of attacks, and to define metrics associated with cyber operations for dynamic defense.

AB  - Recently, A malware is increasing for leaking personal data, credit information, financial information, etc. The secondary damage is also rapidly increasing such as the illegal use of stolen name, financial fraud, etc. But when a system is infected by a malware of leaking information, the existing malware evidence collection modules do not provide evidences conveniently or sometimes cannot provide necessary evidences. So security officials have much difficulty in responding to malwares. This paper analyzes the current status and problems of the existing evidence collection module and suggests new ways to improve those problems.

AB  - This paper presents results of a failure data analysis of a LAN of Windows NT machines. Data for the study was obtained from event logs collected over a six-month period from the mail routing network of a commercial organization. The study focuses on characterizing causes of machine reboots. The key observations from this study are: 1) most of the problems that lead to reboots are software related; 2) rebooting the machine does not always solve the problem; 3) there are indications of propagated or correlated failures; and 4) though the average availability evaluates to over 99%, the machine downtime lasts (on average) two hours. Since the machines are dedicated mail servers, bringing down one or more of them can potentially disrupt storage, forwarding, reception and delivery of mail. This suggests that the average availability is not a good measure to characterize this type of network service

AB  - In recent years there has been a movement toward deployment of distributed approaches for electronic commerce. Intelligent software agents, for instance, may be instructed to act oh behalf of human users in electronic transactions. A challenge with this approach is that the agents would be entrusted with access to sensitive personal or business information. How can this sensitive information be protected from unauthorized access? How can agents negotiate across jurisdictional boundaries; both corporate, and country? The latter question is of particular concern when one considers the potential for considerable variance between the regulations and policies of different governments and corporations. This is especially evident with the disparity of legislation for privacy in different countries. How can disparate regulations be accommodated effectively? What technologies are appropriate for maintaining user privacy and for protecting sensitive information for agent-based e-commerce? In this paper, we describe the issues that provoke privacy challenges for agent-based e-commerce due to current and impending privacy legislation as well as an approach for policy-driven privacy negotiation for use in distributed agent-based systems.

AB  - Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) received much attention from academia and industry lately. However, scant research information on evaluation frameworks regarding PETs is available. Recent developments delineate between different Pets based on high-level principles and privacy concerns. The goal of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we present a framework for evaluating Pets in general based on acknowledged positive characteristics of Pets sourced from literature. Secondly, we use this framework to demonstrate how different PETs can be evaluated and benchmarked against each other. We performed an experimental evaluation of our recently proposed Hippocratic Privacy Protection (HPP) framework, benchmarking it against other well-published PETs including Hippocratic databases, PRIME/Prime Life and Encore to demonstrate the applicability of the evaluation framework. The main contribution of the paper is the provisioning of a PET evaluation framework based on a number of PET evaluation criteria and features to determine its efficacy in giving individuals control over their personal information. We then outline several future research directions.

AB  - Cloud computing is a promising approach for the efficient use of computational resources. It delivers computing as a service rather than a product for a fraction of the cost. However, security concerns prevent many individuals and organizations from using clouds despite its cost effectiveness. Resolving security problems of clouds may alleviate concerns and increase cloud usage; in consequence, it may decrease overall costs spent for the computational devices and infrastructures. This paper particularly focuses on the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds. Security of PaaS clouds is considered from multiple perspectives including access control, privacy and service continuity while protecting both the service provider and the user. Security problems of PaaS clouds are explored and classified. Countermeasures are proposed and discussed. The achieved solutions are intended to be the rationales for future PaaS designs and implementations.

AB  - New born infant kidnapping is a prevailing and horrific crime in governmental run hospitals in major cities and towns around Pakistan. In order to tackle this problem a novel idea of using Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) supported by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is proposed. The working model recommends a Trigger (passive PIRs) based video motes sensors installed at various concealed points, ubiquitously deployed in and around the maternity or nursery ward; while new born babies are tagged with RFID heel-bands. This paper principally covers the WSN aspect of the project and only gives functioning concepts of the RFID portion. The Zigbee transceiver selected for the solution was ATMEL's ATZB-A24-UFL with the controller, ATmega164p. The WSN ad-hoc network is based on a mesh topology allowing for hoping of data between motes extending the communication radius. The video provides an effective and energy efficient way of transmitting jpegs at 4fps passive and 1 frame per 12 second for active monitoring. The nodes are extremely cost efficient especially compared to Commercial of the Self (COTS) surveillance cameras and far smaller in size. A customized application is also developed, to monitor and provide Social Network Forensics (SNF) as a forensic tool for post incident analysis. The paper presents the complete System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) of solution.

AB  - In this paper, we present our effort in developing a failure prediction model based on event logs collected from IBM BlueGene/L. We first show how the event records can be converted into a data set that is appropriate for running classification techniques. Then we apply classifiers on the data, including RIPPER (a rule-based classifier), support vector machines (SVMs), a traditional Nearest Neighbor method, and a customized nearest neighbor method. We show that the customized nearest neighbor approach can outperform RIPPER and SVMs in terms of both coverage and precision. The results suggest that the customized nearest neighbor approach can be used to alleviate the impact of failures.

AB  - As the Internet has matured, so have the threats to its safe use, and so must the security measures that enable its business use. Traditional piecemeal, single-layer, single-dimensional security approaches are no longer adequate. These approaches can create a false sense of security and create as many problems as they attempt to address. We propose a multifaceted framework to prevent, detect, and respond to ever more sophisticated threats to enterprise IT information and assets. We outline a practical implementation approach to building enterprise IT security mechanisms in an incremental and continuous fashion. We believe that enterprises should adopt a similar multifaceted framework, following a practical but disciplined implementation approach. Enterprises must treat IT security as a required business enabler rather than just a costly item with low priority

AB  - Cloud computing has drawn much attention in recent years. One of its delivery models, called infrastructure as a service (IaaS), provides users with infrastructure services such as computation and data storage, heavily dependent upon virtualization techniques that offers benefits such as elasticity and cost efficiency. Most of current IaaS service providers have adopted a user-based service model, where users are directly mapped to virtualized resources that they want to use and they are charged based on usage. Hence, user and resource management are centralized and easily administered at the IaaS provider. However, this also results in the lack of support for scalable management of users and resources, organization-level security policy, let alone flexible pricing model. Considering the increasing popularity of cloud computing, there is a strong need for a more scalable and flexible IaaS model, along with a more fine grained access control mechanism. In this paper we propose a domain-based framework for provisioning and managing users and virtualized resources in IaaS to address this issue. Specifically, an additional layer called domain is introduced to the user-based service model, and the domain layer facilitates the de-centralization of user and virtualized resource management in IaaS. The cloud service provider is able to delegate its administrative works to domains, and domains manage their users and virtualized resources allocated from the cloud service provider. Our framework provides benefits such as scalable user/resource management, domain-based advanced policy support, and flexible pricing.

AB  - Increasing dependence on cyberspace makes preparedness against cyber threats integral to mission assurance. The nature of cyber threats in general - and advanced persistent threats in particular - requires a longer-term commitment from senior leadership, including vision, strategy, and investment prioritization as well as the organizational agility to respond to ever-changing tactics and techniques. The cyber preparedness (Cyber Prep) methodology enables an organization to (1) characterize the cyber threats that an organization or mission faces; (2) determine the level of preparedness necessary to ensure mission success; (3) facilitate strategic planning for cyber security by setting preparedness objectives; and (4) establish priorities for cyber security investment planning and management decisions. This paper presents the framework underlying the Cyber Prep methodology.

AB  - Security is one of the biggest concerns of any company that has an IT infrastructure. Windows event logs are a very useful source of data for security information, but sometimes can be nearly impossible to use due to the complexity of log data or the number of events generated per minute. For this reason, event log data must be automatically processed so that an administrator is given a list of events that actually need the administrator's attention. This has been standard in intrusion detection systems for many years to find anomalies in network traffic, but has not been common in event log processing. This paper will adapt these intrusion detection techniques for Windows event log data sets to find anomalies in these log data sets.

AB  - This paper describes a case study of Honey pot deployment in an organizational network. As per Wikipedia &#x201C;honey pot is a trap that is set to detect, deflect, or in some manner counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems&#x201D;. These traps could be any digital resource ranging from a single computer to a network of such computers or a network application that appears to be a part of organizational network resources but is actually a fake resource with no production traffic. Further these resources are closely monitored and the traffic to and from these resources is well under the control of the administrator. In the experiment performed in this paper, such a trap is laid in the form of a low interaction honeypot honeyd in the perimeter security of an organizational network. The results of deployment are presented and further various props and cons of such deployments are brought about.

AB  - If industry visionaries are correct, our lives will soon be full of sensors, connected together in loose conglomerations via wireless networks, each monitoring and collecting data about the environment at large. These sensors behave very differently from traditional database sources: they have intermittent connectivity, are limited by severe power constraints, and typically sample periodically and push immediately, keeping no record of historical information. These limitations make traditional database systems inappropriate for queries over sensors. We present the Fjords architecture for managing multiple queries over many sensors, and show how it can be used to limit sensor resource demands while maintaining high query throughput. We evaluate our architecture using traces from a network of traffic sensors deployed on Interstate 80 near Berkeley and present performance results that show how query throughput, communication costs and power consumption are necessarily coupled in sensor environments

AB  - Imagine that you're building a software system that collects healthcare data and financial information from its users. It might seem obvious that this personal information should be protected from prying eyes through access control mechanisms, audit trails, transaction controls, transmission encryption, and so on--in fact, perhaps so obvious that in many cases people perform only a cursory security analysis and produce rather generic security requirements. But is this the right way to build secure software? Are security requirements so similar across projects that we simply don't need to invest the time to explore product-level needs or to document requirements at an individual level for each project? The Web extra at http://youtu.be/qoocRI-7yRQ is an audio podcast in which author Jane Cleland-Huang discusses the importance of making informed decisions about how much time and effort to invest in analyzing security needs and specifying product-level security requirements.

AB  - Modern e-Health systems require advanced computing and storage capabilities, leading to the adoption of technologies like the grid and giving birth to novel health grid systems. In particular, intensive care medicine uses this paradigm when facing a high flow of data coming from intensive care unit's (ICU) inpatients just like demonstrated by the ICGrid system prototyped by the University of Cyprus. Unfortunately, moving an ICU patient's data from the traditionally isolated hospital's computing facilities to data grids via public networks (i.e., the Internet) makes it imperative to establish an integral and standardized security solution to avoid common attacks on the data and metadata being managed. Particular emphasis must be put on the patient's personal data, the protection of which is required by legislations in many countries of the European Union and the world in general. In this paper, we extend our previous research with the following contributions: 1) a mandatory access control model to protect patient's metadata; 2) a major security revision to our previously proposed privacy protocol by contributing with a &#x201C;quality of security&#x201D; quantitative metric to improve fragmented data's assurance; and finally, 3) a set of early results to demonstrate that our protocol not only improves a patient personal data's security and privacy but also achieves a performance comparable with existing approaches.

AB  - Data retention refers to the legal obligation of Internet service providers (ISPs) to retain the communication data of their subscribers for a certain period, in order to enable the legal investigation of possible crimes. However, the retention of communication data increases the security threats against the privacy of theirs subscribers. In this paper we explore the privacy issues of data retention in Internet communications. We also describe possible security mechanisms which may thwart these threats and minimize the risks against user privacy.

AB  - The advent of cloud computing allows the provision of several commodities "as-a-service". For enterprise systems, a particularly interesting business model is the offer of configurable business processes for different consumers, which can then outsource their execution onto the cloud. Although such an outsourcing harbors a vast economic potential, both external and internal auditing pose a general challenge for their acceptance. This paper reviews the role of remote auditing as a means to address this issue and indicates research directions for automated tool support.

AB  - Third-generation (3G) mobile phones are capable of high data rate Internet connection and promise seamless connectivity for a free roaming user. They can provide an "always on" Internet, and make a range of services, traditionally available on desktop computers, accessible to mobile users, irrespective of their location. Providing adequate security for these phones and the services that they offer is a central concern for their acceptability and uptake. We briefly review the security of second generation mobile phones and then discuss security architecture proposed for 3G phones. The new security issues that are of importance because of the combination of their advanced capabilities and limitations are discussed.

The focus is on how to integrate many of the concepts in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) security addendum into the framework of the TCSEC. The discussion covers the protocol architectural issues of the trusted network with particular emphasis on the relationship among network protocols, protocol reference model, and network security. It is argued that application of the TCSEC to computer networks requires incorporation of a network protocol reference model as implemented in a protocol suite.

AB  - Most of the early Virtual Private Networks (VPN) connection came from the vendors of networking hardware and software to satisfy one time goal of security in communication in a remote way. The first and foremost of the solution of VPN is to introduce the security protocols like IPSec. IPSec uses cryptography in order to encrypt and authenticate the traffic flowing between point of interest. This is a large set of related protocols operating above the IP layer of the OSI stack, each represented by an RFC specification. It is required that each vendor implements these specifications exactly, in order to be able to interoperate with other vendors. The IPsec access configuration is suffered from non-standardization as the vendors have the liberty of implementing the access requirements that are not restrictive by a specific standard. This paper presents a survey of various VPN categories and some specific products. It outlines the compliance requirement as per various domain specific security policy. The paper shows a successful mechanism to incorporate the compliance requirement into the body of security protocols or firewalls of VPN enhancing the VPN security further as per standard. Such enhanced VPN security satisfies legal bindings as it satisfies the compliance rules/laws of a country. The paper also summarizes the interoperability issues that appear when configuring IPsec on different vendor devices and draws a few conclusions on the level of protocol compliance deciding which VPN solution a customer needs for his/her business.

AB  - In regulated domains such as finance and health care, failure to comply with regulation can lead to financial, civil and criminal penalties. While systems vary from organization to organization, regulations apply across organizations. We propose the use of Behavior-Driven-Development (BDD) scenarios as the basis of an automated compliance test suite for standards such as regulation and interoperability. Such test suites could become a shared asset for use by all systems subject to these regulations and standards. Each system, then, need only create their own system-specific test driver code to automate their compliance checks. The goal of this research is to enable organizations to compare their systems to regulation in a repeatable and traceable way through the use of BDD. To evaluate our proposal, we developed an abbreviated HIPAA test suite and applied it to three open-source electronic health record systems. The scenarios covered all security behavior defined by the selected regulation. The system-specific test driver code covered all security behavior defined in the scenarios, and identified where the tested system lacked such behavior.

Many challenges face the development and application of distributed, agent-based solutions for CSCW. A concern often overlooked is the acceptability and social impact of these technologies. In particular, the management of the privacy of collaborators is a paramount issue that must be accommodated. Included and related to the privacy of user information and interactions are assurances of integrity, certification, validation, ownership, non-repudiation, and authentication of individuals and software systems operating on disparate computers and operating systems, communicating over heterogeneous networks. We outline our early work on an approach for accountable privacy that may be applied to distributed computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) environments. Particular challenges for the issue of privacy associated with the CSCW application scenario are discussed

AB  - Forensic investigations have traditionally relied on data that exists as a by-product of normal operating system and application operation on a system following an incident. We propose a research agenda targeted at expanding the information available to an investigator in computing environments in which software can be installed on the target systems ahead of any incident. In these cases, information can be preserved proactively and stored until needed for examination. In our first ongoing project, we are working to modify a file system to selectively recover disk blocks that are less likely to contain useful information when space is needed for a new file. In our second, we are keeping small amounts of information about files on a system that are deleted, copied, or modified. This allows us to perform certain types of investigations on files that are overwritten or otherwise missing from the system.

AB  - Security has been a critical issue in e-commerce, where absolute security confidentiality of information exchange is requited. Because of the shortage of traditional database security protection mechanism, an active database intrusion prevention system is proposed to monitor the database application layer activities. The architecture of database intrusion prevention system is designed, including a security control module, intrusion detection module, audit and configuration module as well as alarm module, which could be applied in e-commerce applications.

AB  - Many business processes require documents and transactions with trusted signatures. This has been a key issue that blocks enterprises from transforming paper-based business processes into e-business processes. Digital signature and PKI technology make it possible that documents and transactions with the need for signatures can be electronically signed and processed. We describe in this paper the design and implementation of an enterprise portal for secure document management. The portal is a Web-based management system that can be used to, at the enterprise level, streamline document-based business and personal transactions, and securely maintain e-documents in the centralized database. To automate and secure the process of document-based transactions, e.g., filing travel expense reports, the system integrated digital signature and PKI technology for digitally signing and managing documents and forms. Compared to other systems, it is open to various types of user authentication mechanisms, it supports the signing and verification of most document formats, and it provides a Web service endpoint for application integration, aggregation, and automation.

AB  - Information security metrics are very important to guide the direction for measuring the effectiveness of security controls in compliance with the information security standards. However, lack of method to guide organization in choosing the technical security metrics may cause technical security control objectives and capabilities failed. This research proposes a model of technical security metrics to measure the effectiveness of network security management, such as network security controls and services such as firewall and Intrusion Detection Prevention System (IDPS) in the protection of Supervisory and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The methodology used is Plan-Do-Check-Act process model. The proposed technical security metric provides guidance for SCADA owners in complying with requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS) standard. The proposed model should be able to provide a comprehensive measurement and prove the effectiveness of ISO/IEC 27004 ISMS Measurement standard.

AB  - In the past few years, web-based applications and their data management needs have changed dramatically. Relational databases are often being replaced by other viable alternatives, such as NoSQL databases, for reasons of scalability and heterogeneity. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is an agile database built for scalability, performance and high availability. It can be deployed in single server environment and also on complex multi-site architectures. MongoDB provides high performance for read and write operations by leveraging in-memory computing. Although researchers have motivated the need for MongoDB, not much appears in the area of log management. Efficient log management techniques are needed for various reasons including security, accountability, and improving the performance of the system. Towards this end, we analyze the different logging methods offered by MongoDB and compare them to the NIST standard. Our analysis indicates that profiling and mongosniff are useful for log management and we present a simple model that combines the two techniques.

AB  - This paper describes an application of data mining and machine learning to discovering network traffic anomalies in firewall logs. There is a variety of issues and problems that can occur with systems that are protected by firewalls. These systems can be improperly configured, operate unexpected services, or fall victim to intrusion attempts. Firewall logs often generate hundreds of thousands of audit entries per day. It is often easy to use these records for forensics if one knows that something happened and when. However, it can be burdensome to attempt to manually review logs for anomalies. This paper uses data mining techniques to analyze network traffic, based on firewall audit logs, to determine if statistical analysis of the logs can be used to identify anomalies

AB  - Today's forensic techniques for databases are primarily focused on logging mechanisms and artifacts accessible in the database management systems (DBMSs). While log files, plan caches, cache clock hands, etc. can reveal past transactions, a malicious administrator's modifications might be much more difficult to detect, because he can cover his tracks by also manipulating the log files and flushing transient artifacts such as caches. The internal structure of the data storage inside databases, however, has not yet received much attention from the digital forensic research community. In this paper, we want to show that the diversity of B<sup>+</sup>-Trees, a widely used data structure in today's database storage engines, enables a deep insight of the database's history. Hidden manipulations such as predated INSERT operations in a logging database can be revealed by our approach. We introduce novel forensic techniques for B<sup>+</sup>-Trees that are based on characteristics of the tree structure and show how database management systems would have to be modified to even better support tree forensic techniques.

AB  - Cloud computing provides business new working paradigm with the benefit of reducing cost and sharing resource. Tasks from different users may be performed on the same machine. Therefore, one primary security concern is whether user data is secure in cloud. On the other hand, hacker may facilitate cloud computing to launch larger range of attack, such as a request of port scan in cloud with multiple virtual machines executing such malicious action. The hacker may perform a sequence of attacks in order to compromise his target system in a cloud, for example, compromsing an easy-to-exploit machine in the cloud and then using the compromised to attack the target. Such attack plan may be stealthy or inside the computing environment, so intrusion detection system or firewall has difficulty to identify it. The proposed detection system analyzes multiple logs from the cloud and extracts the intensions of the actions recorded in the logs. Stealthy reconnaissance actions are often neglected by administrator for the insignificant number of violations. Hidden Markov model is adopted to model the steps of the attack plan performed by hacker and such stealthy events in a long time frame will become significant in the state-aware model. The results show that the proposed system can identify the attack plans in the real network.
