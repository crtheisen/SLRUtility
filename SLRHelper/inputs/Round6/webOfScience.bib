Abstract = {{ALMA Software is a complex distributed system installed in more than one
   hundred of computers, which interacts with more than one thousand of
   hardware device components. A normal observation follows a flow that
   interacts with almost that entire infrastructure in a coordinated way.
   The Software Operation Support team (SOFTOPS) comprises specialized
   engineers, which analyze the generated software log messages in daily
   basis to detect bugs, failures and predict eventual failures. These log
   message can reach up to 30 GB per day. We describe a decoupled and
   non-intrusive log analysis framework and implemented tools to identify
   well known problems, measure times taken by specific tasks and detect
   abnormal behaviors in the system in order to alert the engineers to take
   corrective actions. The main advantage of this approach among others is
   that the analysis itself does not interfere with the performance of the
   production system, allowing to run multiple analyzers in parallel. In
   this paper we'll describe the selected framework and show the result of
   some of the implemented tools.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To report the results of a systematic literature review
   concerning the security and privacy of electronic health record (EHR)
   systems.
   Data sources: Original articles written in English found in MEDLINE, ACM
   Digital Library, Wiley Inter-Science, IEEE Digital Library,
   Science@Direct, MetaPress, ERIC, CINAHL and Trip Database.
   Study selection: Only those articles dealing with the security and
   privacy of EHR systems.
   Data extraction: The extraction of 775 articles using a predefined
   search string, the outcome of which was reviewed by three authors and
   checked by a fourth.
   Results: A total of 49 articles were selected, of which 26 used
   standards or regulations related to the privacy and security of EHR
   data. The most widely used regulations are the Health Insurance
   Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European Data
   Protection Directive 95/46/EC. We found 23 articles that used symmetric
   key and/or asymmetric key schemes and 13 articles that employed the
   pseudo anonymity technique in EHR systems. A total of 11 articles
   propose the use of a digital signature scheme based on PKI (Public Key
   Infrastructure) and 13 articles propose a login/password (seven of them
   combined with a digital certificate or PIN) for authentication. The
   preferred access control model appears to be Role-Based Access Control
   (RBAC), since it is used in 27 studies. Ten of these studies discuss who
   should define the EHR systems' roles. Eleven studies discuss who should
   provide access to EHR data: patients or health entities. Sixteen of the
   articles reviewed indicate that it is necessary to override defined
   access policies in the case of an emergency. In 25 articles an audit-log
   of the system is produced. Only four studies mention that system users
   and/or health staff should be trained in security and privacy.
   Conclusions: Recent years have witnessed the design of standards and the
   promulgation of directives concerning security and privacy in EHR
   systems. However, more work should be done to adopt these regulations
   and to deploy secure EHR systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The inability to effectively track data in cloud computing environments
   is becoming one of the top concerns for cloud stakeholders. This
   inability is due to two main reasons. Firstly, the lack of data tracking
   tools built for clouds. Secondly, current logging mechanisms are only
   designed from a system-centric perspective. There is a need for
   data-centric logging techniques which can trace data activities (e. g.
   file creation, edition, duplication, transfers, deletions, etc.) within
   and across all cloud servers. This will effectively enable full
   transparency and accountability for data movements in the cloud. In this
   paper, we introduce S2Logger, a data event logging mechanism which
   captures, analyses and visualizes data events in the cloud from the data
   point of view. By linking together atomic data events captured at both
   file and block level, the resulting sequence of data events depicts the
   cloud data provenance records throughout the data lifecycle. With this
   information, we can then detect critical data-related cloud security
   problems such as malicious actions, data leakages and data policy
   violations by analysing the data provenance. S2Logger also enables us to
   address the gaps and inadequacies of existing system-centric security
   tools.}},

Abstract = {{Forensic analysis of software log files is used to extract user behavior
   profiles, detect fraud, and check compliance with policies and
   regulations. Software systems maintain several types of log files for
   different purposes. For example, a system may maintain logs for
   debugging, monitoring application performance, and/or tracking user
   access to system resources. The objective of my research is to develop
   and validate a minimum set of log file attributes and software security
   metrics for user nonrepudiation by measuring the degree to which a given
   audit log file captures the data necessary to allow for meaningful
   forensic analysis of user behavior within the software system. For a log
   to enable user nonrepudiation, the log file must record certain data
   fields, such as a unique user identifier. The log must also record
   relevant user activity, such as creating, viewing, updating, and
   deleting system resources, as well as software security events, such as
   the addition or revocation of user privileges. Using a grounded theory
   method, I propose a methodology for observing the current state of
   activity logging mechanisms in healthcare, education, and finance, then
   I quantify differences between activity logs and logs not specifically
   intended to capture user activity. I will then propose software security
   metrics for quantifying the forensic-ability of log files. I will
   evaluate my work with empirical analysis by comparing the performance of
   my metrics on several types of log files, including both activity logs
   and logs not directly intended to record user activity. My research will
   help software developers strengthen user activity logs for facilitating
   forensic analysis for user nonrepudiation.}},

Abstract = {{Forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify
   suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to
   form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability
   to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past
   two decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed
   information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to
   improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that
   transparently monitors and records data access events within a
   virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the
   hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and
   follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after
   the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these
   transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for
   faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the
   changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we
   provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case
   study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable
   information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been
   detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking
   mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple
   disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed
   over the Internet on an as-needed basis. A major feature of the cloud
   services is that users' data are usually processed remotely in unknown
   machines that users do not own or operate. While enjoying the
   convenience brought by this new emerging technology, users' fears of
   losing control of their own data (particularly, financial and health
   data) can become a significant barrier to the wide adoption of cloud
   services. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel
   highly decentralized information accountability framework to keep track
   of the actual usage of the users' data in the cloud. In particular, we
   propose an object-centered approach that enables enclosing our logging
   mechanism together with users' data and policies. We leverage the JAR
   programmable capabilities to both create a dynamic and traveling object,
   and to ensure that any access to users' data will trigger authentication
   and automated logging local to the JARs. To strengthen user's control,
   we also provide distributed auditing mechanisms. We provide extensive
   experimental studies that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness
   of the proposed approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper comprehends our work on assessing the feasibility of
   utilizing different NoSQL databases in handling a huge tree data
   structure with heterogeneous nodes in which heterogeneity implies that
   each node can embody a unique attribute set. It is a prominent
   requirement arising in structured log analysis where constituents in a
   software log file are scrutinized hierarchically. Traditional pills from
   relational databases fail in handling this efficiently. We lean towards
   NoSQL paradigm, which has been emerging as a prominent solution for
   dealing with high volumes of data with localized characteristics. Our
   exploration probes five different NoSQL models: wide column store,
   document store, tuple store, graph databases and multi-model databases
   that collectively account for a large fraction of the entire NoSQL
   spectrum.
   An experiment is designed to measure database performance against a
   generic tree API focusing on node insertion, node query and
   attribute-value query. The API is then implemented in a database
   selected from each of the five NoSQL models in concern. Implementations
   are used for testing the database performance with respect to the three
   operations by measuring time taken for a batch of similar operations in
   a machine with average hardware and software configuration. A summary of
   experiment results is provided along with the details on tree
   implementation methodology in each database. A discussion that
   highlights the congruence between observed performance differences among
   databases and the theoretical NoSQL models they represent is also
   included.}},

Abstract = {{Accountability is a very important topic for computer and networking
   systems. It helps to answer questions such as, What happened? and, Who
   did it? These two questions are also related to forensics; however,
   forensics normally tries to answer these questions by adding some human
   factors (such as a guess or an instinct due to missing evidence, as well
   as human involvements) under the available system. Accountability, on
   the other hand, can only be achieved by significantly improving the
   current system with the result that forensics becomes trivial in an
   accountable system. Furthermore, each entity in the system must be held
   responsible for its activities. In order to provide accountability, a
   better logging system is necessary so that not only their activities but
   also their relationships may be captured. To this end, our previous work
   proposed a novel logging mechanism, flow-net methodology, for
   accountability. In this paper, we extend the flow-net methodology and
   present its design and implementation in wireless networks. We also
   evaluate the performance of flow-net and compare it with that of audit
   log files. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In modern computer networks and IT systems, event logging is commonly
   used for collecting system health information, in order to ease the
   system management process. For example, many sites are collecting events
   and network flow records from their applications, servers, and network
   devices over protocols like syslog, SNMP and Netflow, and analyze these
   data at central monitoring server(s). Among collected data, many events
   and records provide information about security incidents. Unfortunately,
   during the last decade security logs have grown rapidly in size, making
   the manual analysis extremely labor intensive task. This task is further
   complicated by the large number of irrelevant records and false positive
   alerts in security logs. For this reason, the development of methods for
   detecting important events and knowledge from security logs has become a
   key research issue during the recent years. In our paper, we propose
   some methods for tackling this issue in the context of IDS and Netflow
   logs from an organizational network. The first contribution of this
   paper is the study of important properties of IDS and Netflow logs. We
   have conducted our analysis on a number of production system logs
   obtained from a large financial institution, and some of our findings
   are supported by results from other researchers. The second contribution
   of the paper is the proposal of several data mining based and heuristic
   methods for event and knowledge detection from security logs. Our data
   mining methods are based on frequent itemset mining for identifying
   regularities in IDS alert sets and network traffic. These regularities
   are then used for finding unexpected IDS alert patterns and prominent
   network traffic flows. In this paper, we also discuss the
   implementations of the proposed methods in a production environment, and
   provide performance estimates for our implementations. We conclude the
   paper with a short discussion on some promising directions for further
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Accountability implies that any entity should be held responsible for
   its own specific action or behavior so that the entity is part of larger
   chains of accountability. One of the goals of accountability is that
   once an event has transpired, the events that took place are traceable
   so that the causes can be determined afterward. The poor accountability
   provided by today's computers and networks wastes a great deal of money
   and effort; examples include activities to identify whether a system is
   under reconnaissance or attack, and the difficulties of distinguishing
   legitimate emails from phishing attacks. This is due to the simple fact
   that today's computing and network infrastructure was not built with
   accountability in mind. In this article we propose a novel methodology
   called flow-net for accountability. We apply this methodology to media
   access control and routing layers in wireless networks. We then compare
   the performance of flow-net with audit log files. This article presents
   a novel approach for traffic data collection that can also be used for
   forensics and intrusion detection purposes.}},

   now moving towards implementation of various types of monitoring systems
   to detect and prevent IT security breaches. For that purpose, different
   techniques have been used. Logging is one of such technique. Typical
   enterprise consists of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, operating
   systems, legacy applications etc, where each element uses its own
   conventions and formats of logs. It increases the complexity in
   comprehensive analysis of logs to generate real time alerts and it also
   increases time to conduct forensic analysis. In this paper we have
   presented the concept of application level unification of logs in a
   consistent format at centralized locations to detect and prevent real
