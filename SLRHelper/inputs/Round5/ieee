AB  - Forensic analysis of software log files is used to extract user behavior profiles, detect fraud, and check compliance with policies and regulations. Software systems maintain several types of log files for different purposes. For example, a system may maintain logs for debugging, monitoring application performance, and/or tracking user access to system resources. The objective of my research is to develop and validate a minimum set of log file attributes and software security metrics for user nonrepudiation by measuring the degree to which a given audit log file captures the data necessary to allow for meaningful forensic analysis of user behavior within the software system. For a log to enable user nonrepudiation, the log file must record certain data fields, such as a unique user identifier. The log must also record relevant user activity, such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting system resources, as well as software security events, such as the addition or revocation of user privileges. Using a grounded theory method, I propose a methodology for observing the current state of activity logging mechanisms in healthcare, education, and finance, then I quantify differences between activity logs and logs not specifically intended to capture user activity. I will then propose software security metrics for quantifying the forensic-ability of log files. I will evaluate my work with empirical analysis by comparing the performance of my metrics on several types of log files, including both activity logs and logs not directly intended to record user activity. My research will help software developers strengthen user activity logs for facilitating forensic analysis for user nonrepudiation.

AB  - Securely maintaining log records over extended periods of time is very important to the proper functioning of any organization. Integrity of the log files and that of the logging process need to be ensured at all times. In addition, as log files often contain sensitive information, confidentiality and privacy of log records are equally important. However, deploying a secure logging infrastructure involves substantial capital expenses that many organizations may find overwhelming. Delegating log management to the cloud appears to be a viable cost saving measure. In this paper, we identify the challenges for a secure cloud-based log management service and propose a framework for doing the same.

AB  - In order to provide accountability, a better logging system is needed so that not only the activities but also their relationships are captured. To this end, our previous work proposed a novel logging mechanism, flow-net methodology, for accountability. In this paper, we extend the flow-net methodology and present its design and implementation in wireless networks. We also evaluate the performance of flow-net and compare it to that of audit log files.

AB  - Unified Enterprise application security is a new emerging approach for providing protection against application level attacks. Conventional application security approach that consists of embedding security into each critical application leads towards scattered security mechanism that is not only difficult to manage but also creates security loopholes. According to the CSI/FBI computer crime survey report, almost 80% of the security breaches come from authorized users. In this paper, we have worked on the concept of unified security model, which manages all security aspect from a single security window. The basic idea is to keep business functionality separate from security components of the application. Our main focus was on the designing of frame work for unified layer which supports single point of policy control, centralize logging mechanism, granular, context aware access control, and independent from any underlying authentication technology and authorization policy.

AB  - Modern mobile devices are able to run a wide range of thirdparty/service provider applications that provide users with a variety of attractive services. These applications have their own databases on the mobile device; user data pertaining to the application are stored there. The popularity comes with a price: attackers are interested in exploiting the weaknesses of the mobile systems to manipulate personal information of users via malicious code or malware. Another problem is that mobile devices are often stolen or misplaced and stored data, which users value more than the hardware, compromised. We propose a consolidated logging scheme that reflects all transactions performed on all databases of mobile applications. Only a part of this logis stored on the mobile device, thus addressing the conflict between space limitation in these devices and the space requirement of logging; yet, it is tamper-resistant and enables restoration of data through logging. We formalize our claims and explain how our scheme addresses some important problems created by malware and theft.

AB  - Unified enterprise application security is a newly emerging approach for providing protection against application level attacks. Conventional application security approaches that embed security into each critical application results into scattered security mechanism, which is not only difficult to manage but also creates security loopholes. Therefore, new unified enterprise application security concept is evolving in the industry that consists of centralized authentication, access control, incident response and auditing. Industries such as Computer Associate, Cerebit, Entrust, Evidian, IBM Tivoli, Netegrity, Ohlix and SunOne have comes up with the identity and access management solutions that are based on this concept. Significant amount of misunderstanding exists in the industry and research community about appropriate features of such a unified product. Therefore we have proposed new enterprise application security (EAS) comparison framework to compare existing enterprise application security products. This framework helps an enterprise in selecting appropriate application security product. From comparison we found that Computer Associate and Netegrity solutions are the best available solutions, however none of the current available solutions are providing complete enterprise application security. Therefore we have proposed new unified enterprise application security architecture. This architecture provides all basic information security and other critical services such as, auditing, reporting, authentication, access control, confidentiality, integrity, commitment to standards, incident response, scalability. flexibility, manageability, and compliance of regulatory mandates.

AB  - In most of companies or organizations, logs play important role in information security. However, the common security mechanism only backup logs, it is not able to find out traces of intruders because the hacker who is able to intrudes the security mechanism of organization would try to alter logs or destroy important intrusion evidences making it impossible to preserve evidence using traditional log security strategies. Thus, logs are not considered as evidence to prove the damage. In that case, digital evidence lacks in terms of completeness which makes it difficult to perform computer forensics operations. In order to maintain the completeness and reliability of evidence for later forensic procedures and intrusion detection, the study applies concepts of steganography to logs forensics, for which even intrusion altered records will be kept as well. Comparing to traditional security strategies, this study proposes a better logging mechanism to ensure the completeness of logs. Furthermore, the study will assist in intrusion detection through alteration behavior, and help in forensic operations.

AB  - With the widespread use of information, variety of security logs have increased greatly, which due need for security log management. Organizations requirements have imposed to collect, store, and analyze tremendous volumes of log data across entire infrastructure for extended durations and at increasingly granular levels. It is the process of generating, transmitting, storing, analyzing, and disposing security log data from network to databases. Due to the wide variety of logs, storing comprises different methods. Recorded events in collection module are processed, normalized and classified. Logs are stored in storage module in order to use in forensic, reviewing, auditing and providing further necessities of correlation module. Routine log correlation analysis is beneficial for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activities, troubleshooting and operational network problems. So log management is an important and efficient activity in network monitoring. Finding an effective log management functional architecture for network events analysis is the main goal of this paper. In this paper, we aim to suggest log management architecture with more common functions that are used by vendors. By studying logging architectures the main functions are administration of log collection, normalizing, categorization, queuing prioritizing and storing logged events/alarms by sensors. Log functions are different but the suitable architecture must justify the functions to send a normative, synchronized and prioritized log in an efficient way. The mentioned functions are gathered from SIEM products characteristics. Suggested architecture includes functions and activities in log collection server and storage server.

AB  - Cloud computing has emerged as a popular computing paradigm in recent years. However, today's cloud computing architectures often lack support for computer forensic investigations. A key task of digital forensics is to prove the presence of a particular file in a given storage system. Unfortunately, it is very hard to do so in a cloud given the black-box nature of clouds and the multi-tenant cloud models. In clouds, analyzing the data from a virtual machine instance or data stored in a cloud storage only allows us to investigate the current content of the cloud storage, but not the previous contents. In this paper, we introduce the idea of building proofs of past data possession in the context of a cloud storage service. We present a scheme for creating such proofs and evaluate its performance in a real cloud provider. We also discuss how this proof of past data possession can be used effectively in cloud forensics.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a lightweight solution for protecting real-time collaborative editing systems against Byzantine faults. We observe that a centralized coordination algorithm not only reduces the complexity of the editing system, it makes easier to harden the system with Byzantine fault tolerance. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the potential threats towards collaborative editing systems and introduce a set of Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms without requiring any additional redundant resources. If the system has sufficient redundancy, such mechanisms can be used to ensure strong protection against various malicious faults. Even without sufficient redundancy in the system, our mechanisms would still help limit the damages caused by a faulty user.

A citizen can reconstruct the trail of such a process and verify its status if he is the subject of that process. Reconstruction is based on hand-overs, special types of log events, that link data stored by multiple logging servers, which are not necessarily trusted. Our scheme is privacy-friendly in the sense that only the authorised subject, i.e. the citizen, can link the different log entries related to one specific process. The scheme is also auditable; it allows logging servers to show that they behave according to a certain policy.

AB  - In the dawn of the information age, information has been attributed with an utmost important asset of an organization. There has been manifold rise in the information from past few decades. Information exchange has become the need of business continuity and is required for growth of the organization. Various methods have been introduced for an exchange of information but email has evolved as the prime means of communication for all the organizations. The inherent simplicity of email system has become the prime factor for its popularity. With the increase in information rate, there has been exponential rise in the security threats as well. Email though has inherent simplicity but it has an inherent weak security as well. Email systems are vulnerable to various types of attacks and threats including SMTP - auth attacks, denial of service attacks and also it can act as medium for phishing and pharming attacks. This paper will explain inherent weakness in email infrastructure and methodologies to improve the security of the email infrastructure and also will highlight good and weak practices in varying aspects of email infrastructure design paradigm. The paper will also highlight the implementation of Email Security in IPS Academy.

AB  - Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) used in critical infrastructure typically perform their tasks using embedded devices. While the security of the embedded devices during the operation of the system is naturally the focus of security considerations, the security of the engineering framework is often overlooked. In this paper, we model the trust boundaries of a typical engineering tool used in an IACS, identify security risks in this context, suggest mitigation techniques for end users, and finally propose an architecture that allows to implement secure engineering frameworks.

AB  - While log data are being increasingly used as digital evidence in court, the extent to which existing secure logging protocols used to collect log data fulfill the legal requirements for admissible evidence remain largely unclear. This paper elucidates a subset of the necessary secure requirements for digital evidence and extensively surveys the state of the art secure logging protocols, thereby demonstrating that none of the current protocols completely fulfills the elucidated requirements for admissible evidence. In analyzing the shortcoming of logging protocols, the paper also elaborates on the related research challenges.

AB  - Trustable log data is essential in digital forensic investigations in order to allow reliable reconstruction of events. Existing solutions do not provide adequate protection, exposing the log-producing application to software-based attacks. In this paper we provide a solution based on Trusted Computing using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and AMD's Secure Virtual Machine technology (SVM). While current solutions only protect against manipulation of existing logs, we go one step further by establishing hardware-based trust in the log producing application. Our solution ensures confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation during creation, storage and transmission of log data.

AB  - A-priori access control techniques allow granting access to a set of predefined agents. In some processes, we cannot define in advance the set of authorized agents because the characteristics of the process instance determine activity assignment. A-posteriori access control allows access to many agents who claim being authorized. It implements an audit process permitting to check the behavior of the different agents in the system. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a-posteriori access control and we provide an approach allowing modeling an auditable process by using Business Process Management Notation (BPMN). We express audit requirements through text annotations. Finally, we provide an example from the banking context to illustrate an auditable process.

AB  - Nowadays, computer crime is becoming more and more prevalent. It has the characteristic of high technology, hard to be found and rapid spreading. It brings challenges to computer forensics. Computer forensics focuses on collecting and analyzing various evidences for these crimes. It is far different from the traditional forensics, and becoming more and more hot in enterprise and academic. This paper describes the current state as well as future trends in the research of computer forensics, and illustrates the support mechanism for computer forensics in Linux as a typical platform of widely used software system.

AB  - Growth of network technology and easy internet access are the key features for development and use of Database-as-a-Service (DaaS) technique. In DaaS technique it is necessary to ensure safe and correct operation of any industry. In many cases, the types of data records used to conduct security audits are considered sensitive, as they could reveal information about internal network structures, the types of software running, private customer or employee information. In this paper we suggest a technique based on system of linear equations, which enables a trusted party to give the service provider's server the ability to test whether a given keyword appears in log records but the server learns nothing about the keyword and the log content. We compare our scheme with existing encryption schemes and prove that our scheme is efficient and secure.

We propose using hierarchical P-Accountability to adapt the requirements of modeling a complex network environment and assess the degree of accountability in a fine-grained manner. We have defined P-Accountability and demonstrated its use in the hierarchical network environment. In addition, we apply P-Accountability to a wireless multi-hop network system. Both numerical and simulation results show that our approach is applicable to most accountable systems and that it provides a flexible and comprehensive view of the degree of accountability.

AB  - Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed over the Internet on an as-needed basis. A major feature of the cloud services is that users' data are usually processed remotely in unknown machines that users do not own or operate. While enjoying the convenience brought by this new emerging technology, users' fears of losing control of their own data (particularly, financial and health data) can become a significant barrier to the wide adoption of cloud services. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel highly decentralized information accountability framework to keep track of the actual usage of the users' data in the cloud. In particular, we propose an object-centered approach that enables enclosing our logging mechanism together with users' data and policies. We leverage the JAR programmable capabilities to both create a dynamic and traveling object, and to ensure that any access to users' data will trigger authentication and automated logging local to the JARs. To strengthen user's control, we also provide distributed auditing mechanisms. We provide extensive experimental studies that demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

AB  - The key barrier to widespread uptake of cloud computing is the lack of trust in clouds by potential customers. While preventive controls for security and privacy are actively researched, there is still little focus on detective controls related to cloud accountability and audit ability. The complexity resulting from large-scale virtualization and data distribution carried out in current clouds has revealed an urgent research agenda for cloud accountability, as has the shift in focus of customer concerns from servers to data. This paper discusses key issues and challenges in achieving a trusted cloud through the use of detective controls, and presents the Trust Cloud framework, which addresses accountability in cloud computing via technical and policy-based approaches.

This paper discusses the need for a rigorous model of forensics and outlines qualities that such a model should possess. It presents an overview of a forensic model and an example of how to apply the model to a real-world, multi-stage attack. We show how using the model can result in forensic analysis requiring a much smaller amount of carefully selected, highly useful data than without the model

AB  - Computing resource provisioning through the use of the Cloud computing paradigm has triggered revolutions in modern day computing. It is a new paradigm for deploying services on rented machines. On the other hand, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has gained wide adoption among organizations due to the importance of collaborations and outsourcing. Therefore the Cloud's enormous capacity with comparable low cost makes it an ideal platform for SOA deployment. The overall correctness of the SOA deployed in the Cloud depends on the correctness of all individual participants. As the SOA usually spans multiple administration domains, concluding the faulty service and making the provider responsible become a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel design to achieve Trustworthy Service Oriented Architecture (TSOA) in the Cloud through enforcing strong accountability. In such system not only the root of a fault can always be concluded to the guilty participant(s), each conclusion is supported with non-disputable evidence. We also implemented a demonstrative system to show its effectiveness in real practice. Our testing figure indicates the cost of incorporating our design to SOA in the cloud is acceptable.

AB  - Cloud computing is receiving a great deal of attention, both in publications and among users, from individuals at home to the government. The cloud makes it possible for you to access your information from anywhere at any time. While a traditional computer setup requires you to be in the same location as your data storage device, the cloud takes away that step. The cloud removes the need for you to be in the same physical location as the hardware that stores your data. A major feature of the cloud services is that user data are usually processed remotely in unknown machines that users do not own or operate. Data handling in the cloud goes through a complex and dynamic hierarchical service chain which does not exist in conventional environments. This can be addressed by a novel approach, namely Cloud Information Accountability (CIA) framework. In this every access to the data are correctly and automatically logged. Log files should be sent back to their data owners periodically to inform them of the current usage of their data. More importantly, log files should be retrievable any time by their data owners when needed regardless the location where the files are stored. The end user is allowed to access the data as per their access privileges which they specifies while registering to access the data in the cloud and authentication is provided and accessed data is verified with the original data in the cloud server.

AB  - The utilization of computer has increased and at the same time digital crime has also increased. In olden days physical robbery was very high and now because of the advanced techniques to carry money and other valuables like ATM, people utilize the computer system to carry out robbery. Just like the olden days, where crime has to be investigated; now too the investigator has to investigate the digital crime. This paper presents some of the tools &amp; techniques to analyze the digital crime. The forensic techniques will be used to track where exactly the crime has taken place and where the valuable data are hidden, which are the mails have been sent and received from the seized computer system. The forensic analysis tools are used to analyze the data and to recover the deleted or hidden data from the digital devices.

AB  - Different users apply computer forensic systems, models, and terminology in very different ways. They often make incompatible assumptions and reach different conclusions about the validity and accuracy of the methods they use to log, audit, and present forensic data. This is problematic, because these fields are related, and results from one can be meaningful to the others. We present several forensic systems and discuss situations in which they produce valid and accurate conclusions and also situations in which their accuracy is suspect. We also present forensic models and discuss areas in which they are useful and areas in which they could be augmented. Finally, we present some recommendations about how computer scientists, forensic practitioners, lawyers, and judges could build more complete models of forensics that take into account appropriate legal details and lead to scientifically valid forensic analysis.

This paper gives a detailed overview of what would be required to (1) link log data for multiple services supported by non-local servers and (2) trace cloud-based services, focusing on prevailing web-based cloud services. The paper presents a robust accountability framework and discusses how cryptography could be applied to log data accountability.

AB  - Transparency and confident towards cloud provider are some of the prominent issues in cloud today. In order to solve these problems, cloud service providers should have a high level of assurance and accountability in order to maintain trust between them and the users. This trust can be achieved through data provenance. Data provenance provides historical data from its original resources and can facilitate trust between cloud providers and users. This paper discusses the overview of data provenance in cloud computing and significant approach in provenance logging system. This is then followed by discussion of provenance challenges in cloud environment. Finally, this paper propose a novel data provenance trusted model to provide secured access to data provenance via a secured communication channel. This model also propose a consolidation log storage for virtual and physical layer in cloud environment.

AB  - As cloud computing and virtualization technologies become mainstream, the need to be able to track data has grown in importance. Having the ability to track data from its creation to its current state or its end state will enable the full transparency and accountability in cloud computing environments. In this paper, we showcase a novel technique for tracking end-to-end data provenance, a meta-data describing the derivation history of data. This breakthrough is crucial as it enhances trust and security for complex computer systems and communication networks. By analyzing and utilizing provenance, it is possible to detect various data leakage threats and alert data administrators and owners; thereby addressing the increasing needs of trust and security for customers' data. We also present our rule-based data provenance tracing algorithms, which trace data provenance to detect actual operations that have been performed on files, especially those under the threat of leaking customers' data. We implemented the cloud data provenance algorithms into an existing software with a rule correlation engine, show the performance of the algorithms in detecting various data leakage threats, and discuss technically its capabilities and limitations.

AB  - The inability to effectively track data in cloud computing environments is becoming one of the top concerns for cloud stakeholders. This inability is due to two main reasons. Firstly, the lack of data tracking tools built for clouds. Secondly, current logging mechanisms are only designed from a system-centric perspective. There is a need for data-centric logging techniques which can trace data activities (e.g. file creation, edition, duplication, transfers, deletions, etc.) within and across all cloud servers. This will effectively enable full transparency and accountability for data movements in the cloud. In this paper, we introduce S2Logger, a data event logging mechanism which captures, analyses and visualizes data events in the cloud from the data point of view. By linking together atomic data events captured at both file and block level, the resulting sequence of data events depicts the cloud data provenance records throughout the data lifecycle. With this information, we can then detect critical data-related cloud security problems such as malicious actions, data leakages and data policy violations by analysing the data provenance. S2Logger also enables us to address the gaps and inadequacies of existing system-centric security tools.

AB  - Timestamps are widely used in computing and offer an easy way to determine the time of events in digital investigations. Unfortunately, the ability of users to change clock settings, the difficult to recover the multi-level overwriting data in a disk, etc. can not provide the efficient timestamp for event reasoning. In this paper, we present techniques to use lay technique to deal with the time of a file on local machine, even its data block of a file had been re-written many times or deleted long ago, and adopt the time offset mechanism to deal with the deviation time of the file at time t. Use a logging mechanism to record the time of modifications to each disk block and its deviation time at time t to calculate the real time of a file for reasoning the order of the events and obtaining a timeline of activities on a file.

AB  - As the Internet becomes pervasive, the vulnerability of some fundamental design aspects of the Internet has also become significant. Among which, denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed DoS (DDoS) pose significant problems, as they are disruptive to the useful traffics and are hard to prevent. One solution consists in instituting accountability, which hold the attackers accountable for the attack. The key issue is to identify the real sources of the attacks and attackers use spoofed IP address to hide their actual network location. However, the Internet architecture does not provide intrinsic support for identifying the real sources of IP packets. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to traceback the real sources. Most of such networks have been addressing the IP version 4. In this paper, we address the issues of IP traceback in the context of IPv6 and mobile IPv6. This paper provides a detailed analysis of these issues and problems. The main problem lies with the transformations that are introduced by IPv6 and mobile IPv6 protocols, namely tunneling and addresses manipulation. We then propose a solution, including new ICMPv6 messages for traceback co-ordination, to facilitate the traceback mechanism.

AB  - A new user-mode Linux based virtual honeynet architecture is presented in this paper. The new architecture has improved functionality that is difficult to realize in the GenII honeynet. Two new honeynet capabilities in particular are introduced. Honeypot controller is a new virtual honeynet component that assists in data control. The honeywall promises to have finer control over the honeypots through signal and system call redirections. The second new capability is the disk imager. The disk imager is capable of making forensic images of the virtual machine's file systems for further analysis. Since security for virtual honeynets is a big concern, the new virtual honeynet architecture utilizes security enhanced Linux to isolate the untrusted honeypots from the completely trusted honeywall. SELinux and other research work done in this field made the new honeynet architecture a viable alternative to GenII honeynets. A file system logging mechanism, FSLog, has been developed for the UML based virtual honeynet. In conjunction with the built-in tty logger, UML based honeynets have logging capabilities that are equivalent to their GenII honeynet counterparts. The current version of FSLog successfully logs eighteen virtual file systems system calls including the common, read(), write(), open() and close() functions. Its current functionality and how it pieces into the new architecture is also discussed. This work provides researchers with an alternative honeynet platform. The new virtual honeynet architecture is more portable, easier to setup, more cost effective and as secure as the GenII honeynet. The addition of the honeypot controller and disk imager components also makes the new virtual honeynet architecture more capable.

AB  - With the advent and acceptance of cloud computing the ability to record and account for the usage of cloud resources in a convincing and capricious way has become critical for cloud service providers and users alike. The billing process involves receiving billing records from various networks, determining the billing rates associated with the billing records, calculate the cost for each billing record, aggregating this records periodically to generate invoices, sending invoices to the customer, and collecting payments received from the customer. Traditional billing systems are not enough in terms of security capabilities or computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a secure and no obstructive billing system called THEMIS as a remedy for these limitations. The system uses a novel concept of a cloud notary authority for the supervision of billing. Moreover, to provide a falsification-resistive SLA monitoring mechanism, we devised a SLA monitoring module enhanced with a trusted platform module (TPM), called S-Mon. From the perspective of extensibility, THEMIS is moreover applicable to various target services as well to improve the accountability of each service by applying more monitoring techniques to S-Mon. The overall latency of these systems is shorter and the throughput much higher than the Public key Infrastructure.

The goal with this phase of the work is to implement the proposed method and evaluate the forensic validity of the method under real-world conditions. This paper discusses that implementation and the ability for the generated authentication logs and access fingerprints to both identify malicious activity and identify the source of this activity. While work has been done to develop secure log files, i.e., making them tamper resistant, there has been no prior work to ensure they are forensically valid.

AB  - A number of detection and defense mechanisms have emerged in the last decade to tackle the botnet phenomenon. It is important to organize this knowledge to better understand the botnet problem and its solution space. In this paper, we structure existing botnet literature into three comprehensive taxonomies of botnet behavioral features, detection and defenses. This elevated view highlights opportunities for network defense by revealing shortcomings in existing approaches. We introduce the notion of a dimension to denote different criteria which can be used to classify botnet detection techniques. We demonstrate that classification by dimensions is particularly useful for evaluating botnet detection mechanisms through various metrics of interest. We also show how botnet behavioral features from the first taxonomy affect the accuracy of the detection approaches in the second taxonomy. This information can be used to devise integrated detection strategies by combining complementary approaches. To provide real-world context, we liberally augment our discussions with relevant examples from security research and products.

AB  - Grid portals are an increasingly popular mechanism for creating customizable, Web-based interfaces to grid services and resources. Due to the powerful, general-purpose nature of grid technology, the security of any portal or entry point to such resources cannot be taken lightly. This is particularly true if the portal is running inside of a trusted perimeter, such as a science gateway running on an SDSC machine for access to the TeraGrid. To evaluate the current state of grid portal security, we undertake a comparative analysis of the three most popular grid portal frameworks that are being pursued as frontends to the TeraGrid: GridSphere, OGCE and clarens. We explore general challenges that grid portals face in the areas of authentication (including user identification), authorization, auditing (logging) and session management then contrast how the different grid portal implementations address these challenges. We find that although most grid portals address these security concerns to a certain extent, there is still room for improvement, particularly in the areas of secure default configurations and comprehensive logging and auditing support. We conclude with specific recommendations for designing, implementing and configuring secure grid portals

AB  - IT systems manage increasing amounts of sensitive data and there is a growing concern that they comply with policies that regulate data usage. In this paper, we use temporal logic to express policies and runtime monitoring to check system compliance. While well-established methods for monitoring linearly ordered system behavior exist, a major challenge is monitoring distributed and concurrent systems where actions are locally observed in the different system parts. These observations can only be partially ordered, while policy compliance may depend on the actions' actual order of appearance. Technically speaking, it is in general intractable to check compliance of partially ordered traces. We identify fragments of our policy specification language for which compliance can be checked efficiently, namely, by monitoring a single representative trace in which the observed actions are totally ordered. Through a case study we show that the fragments are capable of expressing nontrivial policies and that monitoring representative traces is feasible on real-world data.

AB  - Forensic investigations have traditionally relied on data that exists as a by-product of normal operating system and application operation on a system following an incident. We propose a research agenda targeted at expanding the information available to an investigator in computing environments in which software can be installed on the target systems ahead of any incident. In these cases, information can be preserved proactively and stored until needed for examination. In our first ongoing project, we are working to modify a file system to selectively recover disk blocks that are less likely to contain useful information when space is needed for a new file. In our second, we are keeping small amounts of information about files on a system that are deleted, copied, or modified. This allows us to perform certain types of investigations on files that are overwritten or otherwise missing from the system.

AB  - In recent years there has been a movement toward deployment of distributed approaches for electronic commerce. Intelligent software agents, for instance, may be instructed to act oh behalf of human users in electronic transactions. A challenge with this approach is that the agents would be entrusted with access to sensitive personal or business information. How can this sensitive information be protected from unauthorized access? How can agents negotiate across jurisdictional boundaries; both corporate, and country? The latter question is of particular concern when one considers the potential for considerable variance between the regulations and policies of different governments and corporations. This is especially evident with the disparity of legislation for privacy in different countries. How can disparate regulations be accommodated effectively? What technologies are appropriate for maintaining user privacy and for protecting sensitive information for agent-based e-commerce? In this paper, we describe the issues that provoke privacy challenges for agent-based e-commerce due to current and impending privacy legislation as well as an approach for policy-driven privacy negotiation for use in distributed agent-based systems.

AB  - Traditional access control mechanisms prevent illegal access by controlling access right before executing an action; they belong to a class of a priori security solutions and, from this point of view, they have some limitations, like inflexibility in unanticipated circumstances. By contrast, a posteriori mechanisms enforce policies not by preventing unauthorized access, but rather by deterring it. Such access control needs evidence to prove violations. Evidence is derived from one or several log records, which trace each user's actions. Efficiency of violation detection mostly depends on the compliance of log records with the access control policy. In order to develop an efficient method for finding these violations, we propose restructuring log records according to a security policy model. We illustrate our methodology by applying it to the healthcare domain, taking care of the IHE (Integrating the healthcare enterprise) framework, particularly its basic security profile, ATNA (Audit Trail and Node Authentication). This profile defines log records established on the analysis of common health practice scenarios. We analyze and establish how ATNA log records can be refined in order to be integrated into an a posteriori access and usage control process, based on an expressive and contextual security policy like the OrBAC policy.

AB  - Software-as-a-service (SaaS) provides developers a new convenient venue to distribute software by utilizing a cloud computing infrastructure. But as vendors start to deploy applications, and users upload data in cloud to utilize them, a new privacy concern arises, because data users would like to preserve their data (and maybe even their identities) private from the software provider. While cloud providers pledge to preserve data privacy, the current SaaS architecture makes it difficult to provide any assurance that the software in the cloud will not be able to make copies or redistribute the data it used. In this paper, we propose a new cloud based infrastructure which allows a clean differentiation between applications and data. We further utilize this differentiation to introduce the concept of trusted data binding, enforcing policy usage on application over data sets with the aid of trusted hardware such as the trusted platform module. We implemented our idea in a prototype system deployed in Amazon EC2, where software providers can upload software and data owners can search for algorithms to be executed privately on their data sets, with policy options such as a number of executions, data expiration and deletion, and encryption of data at rest. We believe that our contributions will be very beneficial for fields such as bioinformatics and software validation, were the software is executed against very sensitive data sets and require a high amount of computational resources.

AB  - The growth of the Internet has been accompanied by the growth of Web services (e.g. e-commerce, e-health). This proliferation of Web services and the increasing regulatory and legal requirements for personal privacy have fueled the need to protect the personal privacy of Web service users. We advocate a privacy policy negotiation approach to protecting personal privacy (Yee and Korba, 2003; ). We provided semiautomated approaches for deriving personal privacy policies (Yee and Korba, 2004). However, it is evident that approaches are also needed to ensure that providers of Web services comply with the privacy policies of service users. In this paper, we examine privacy legislation to derive requirements for privacy policy compliance systems. We then propose an architecture for a privacy policy compliance system that satisfies the requirements and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed architecture.

AB  - Much recent work has focused on the process of auditing the results of elections. Little work has focused on auditing the e-voting systems currently in use. The facilities for doing the former include the voter-verified paper audit trail; unfortunately, that VVPAT is not particularly helpful in tracking down the source of errors within e-voting systems. This paper discusses the need for a detailed forensic audit trail (FAT) to enable auditors to analyze the actions of e-voting systems, in order to demonstrate either the absence of problems or to find the causes of problems. We also discuss methods to prevent the use of the FAT as a covert channel for violating the necessary properties of secrecy of the ballot, so voters cannot sell their votes, and anonymity of the ballot, so a third party cannot associate a particular ballot with the voter who cast it.

AB  - Peer-to-peer (P2P) mesh based streaming systems have gained widespread use for multicasting of audio and video. In approaches based on BitTorrent, members of the swarm share their content availability through gossiping, and redistribute file pieces cached locally. However, such systems are vulnerable to cheating attacks such as fake reporting, selective omission, fake block attack, and neighbor selection attack. These attacks will severely impact quality of service, waste resources, and discourage cooperation among participants. A defense mechanism, called AntiLiar, is proposed for defending against cheating attacks in mesh based streaming. AntiLiar uses a secure progress log that consists of commitments and one-time signatures, and maintains consistency for an expanded neighbor view. Experimental results demonstrate that AntiLiar minimizes required costs, and improves service quality over alternatives in the face of cheating attacks.

AB  - Code injection attacks, despite being well researched, continue to be a problem today. Modern architectural solutions such as the execute-disable bit and PaX have been useful in limiting the attacks; however, they enforce program layout restrictions and can oftentimes still be circumvented by a determined attacker. We propose a change to the memory architecture of modern processors that addresses the code injection problem at its very root by virtually splitting memory into code memory and data memory such that a processor will never be able to fetch injected code for execution. This virtual split memory system can be implemented as a software-only patch to an operating system and can be used to supplement existing schemes for improved protection. Furthermore, our system is able to accommodate a number of response modes when a code injection attack occurs. Our experiments with both benchmarks and real-world attacks show the system is effective in preventing a wide range of code injection attacks while incurring reasonable overhead.

AB  - Since the need of the communication data in revealing the crime are just emerged after the event detected, communication data retention for lawful interception (LI) are really demanded. This paper aim to give recommendation for telecommunication regulatory body in making communication data retention regulation. This research describes points of recommendation to National Telecommunication Regulatory Body in establishing LI data retention regulation which conducted by the Communication Service Provider in the country. These recommendations are very useful for countries that do not have relevant regulations of this field. This paper suggests that propose data retention system must have an ability to run administrative function, data collection function and data management function. Each function should maintain such a log. Administrative log has to keep warrant information include target identity and date start, and the duration of data retention needed. In telecommunication infrastructure target are either MSISDN, IMEI or IMSI. For communication data through IP mechanism, target is either email address, account name or IP address. Information item that have to be retained are include subscriber data, usage data and traffic data, equipment data, network element data, additional service data and the call contents. If storage capacity are not fully provided yet, the retention for data that need the largest storage space such as video and file might be less priority. Regulatory Body must determine the data retention format based on handover interface. To prevent abuse of data, regulation should put clauses that obligate each party to delete data longer than retention period. Besides this paper recommends decentralize location of storage media, apart from operational system and have a hot site backup.

AB  - Tools for computer supported collaborative work offer many advantages for their users. Some developments in this field have included agent-based approaches for CSCW. Many challenges face the development and application of distributed, agent-based solutions for CSCW. A concern often overlooked is the acceptability and social impact of these technologies. In particular, the management of the privacy of collaborators is a paramount issue that must be accommodated. Included and related to the privacy of user information and interactions are assurances of integrity, certification, validation, ownership, non-repudiation, and authentication of individuals and software systems operating on disparate computers and operating systems, communicating over heterogeneous networks. We outline our early work on an approach for accountable privacy that may be applied to distributed computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) environments. Particular challenges for the issue of privacy associated with the CSCW application scenario are discussed

AB  - Cloud computing is a promising approach for the efficient use of computational resources. It delivers computing as a service rather than a product for a fraction of the cost. However, security concerns prevent many individuals and organizations from using clouds despite its cost effectiveness. Resolving security problems of clouds may alleviate concerns and increase cloud usage; in consequence, it may decrease overall costs spent for the computational devices and infrastructures. This paper particularly focuses on the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds. Security of PaaS clouds is considered from multiple perspectives including access control, privacy and service continuity while protecting both the service provider and the user. Security problems of PaaS clouds are explored and classified. Countermeasures are proposed and discussed. The achieved solutions are intended to be the rationales for future PaaS designs and implementations.

AB  - Service-oriented systems facilitate business workflows to span multiple organizations (e.g. by means of Web services). As a side effect, data may be more easily transferred over organizational boundaries. Thus, privacy issues arise. At the same time, there are personal, business and legal requirements for protecting privacy and IPR and allowing customers to request information about how and by whom their data was handled. Managing these requirements constitutes an unsolved technical and organizational problem. We propose to solve the information request problem by attaching meta-knowledge about how data was handled to the data itself. We present our solution, in form of an architecture, a formalization and an implemented prototype for logging and collecting logs in service-oriented and cross-organizational systems.

AB  - Cloud computing is an emerging data interactive paradigm to realize users' data remotely stored in an online cloud server. Cloud services provide great conveniences for the users to enjoy the on-demand cloud applications without considering the local infrastructure limitations. During the data accessing, different users may be in a collaborative relationship, and thus data sharing becomes significant to achieve productive benefits. The existing security solutions mainly focus on the authentication to realize that a user's privative data cannot be illegally accessed, but neglect a subtle privacy issue during a user challenging the cloud server to request other users for data sharing. The challenged access request itself may reveal the user's privacy no matter whether or not it can obtain the data access permissions. In this paper, we propose a shared authority based privacy-preserving authentication protocol (SAPA) to address above privacy issue for cloud storage. In the SAPA, 1) shared access authority is achieved by anonymous access request matching mechanism with security and privacy considerations (e.g., authentication, data anonymity, user privacy, and forward security); 2) attribute based access control is adopted to realize that the user can only access its own data fields; 3) proxy re-encryption is applied to provide data sharing among the multiple users. Meanwhile, universal composability (UC) model is established to prove that the SAPA theoretically has the design correctness. It indicates that the proposed protocol is attractive for multi-user collaborative cloud applications.

AB  - The rise of many kinds of grid systems, and associated security threats, makes very necessary the provision of trustworthy services for audit and logging. However, existing solutions tend to put little emphasis on the security of logging. We present a number of use cases where the logs have security properties in their own rights, and so the logs themselves are highly privileged: hence, these need to be integrity and confidentiality protected while being generated, accessed, reconciled and analysed with distributed services spanning across multiple administrative domains. We derive a common set of secure logging requirements to address the security gaps which exist between these use cases and existing solutions.From the requirements, we propose a novel logging architecture for the grid based on virtual machine (VM) isolation and trusted computing capabilities: a small number of privileged driver VMs trigger all trusted logging requests and forward them to the secure logging service running within the log security manager. The logging service verifies the integrity of the log data and the security configurations of these driver VMs (log generators) before storing the logs.

AB  - Regimen adherence is a key factor in the success of home monitoring of lung transplant recipients. Patients generally adhere satisfactorily with home spirometry in the short-term, but adherence tends to decline over time. Telehealth and Internet technology provide new methods to address this issue. The unique contribution of the Adherence Enhancement Internet Program (AEIP) is the integration of multiple adherence enhancement strategies operating in a unified approach to the adherence problem, while meshing all user groups to facilitate interactions. This Internet-based program focused on promoting subject specific strategies was developed to maintain the initial high levels of adherence beyond the first year post transplant. The program provides more immediate subject feedback related to home monitoring data, reminders from the patient's health care providers, educational material, and guidance in dealing with subject specific barriers to maintaining adherence. It also simplifies communication between patients and health care providers, and supports providers in certain patient care tasks. A feasibility trial involving 12 lung transplant recipients demonstrated that subjects were able to use the AEIP with little training, found it acceptable, and were generally enthusiastic regarding it as a tool to maintain or enhance adherence

AB  - SCADA and industrial control systems have been traditionally isolated in physically protected environments. However, developments such as standardisation of data exchange protocols and increased use of IP, emerging wireless sensor networks and machine-to-machine communication mean that in the near future related threat vectors will require consideration too outside the scope of traditional SCADA security and incident response. In the light of the significance of SCADA for the resilience of critical infrastructures and the related targeted incidents against them (e.g. the development of stuxnet), cyber security and digital forensics emerge as priority areas. In this paper we focus on the latter, exploring the current capability of SCADA operators to analyse security incidents and develop situational awareness based on a robust digital evidence perspective. We look at the logging capabilities of a typical SCADA architecture and the analytical techniques and investigative tools that may help develop forensic readiness to the level of the current threat environment requirements. We also provide recommendations for data capture and retention.

This is due to the fact that in the past hardware has only been optimized for speed - never for security. In this paper we propose a set of hardware features to support system security.

AB  - This paper presents an approach to assess security of Web servers. This method can be used to compare the security features of different Web servers installations and to determine how secure a given Web server configuration is. The assessment is done by applying a set of tests designed to check if the system under evaluation fulfils a set of security practices defined by an extensive field study. This work targets the most typical issues related to Web servers ranging from classic Web servers misconfiguration to the absence of a secure network infrastructure and of well-defined security policies to respond to security incidents. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated through the security assessment and comparison of five different real Web servers.

This research proposes a model of technical security metrics to measure the effectiveness of network security management, such as network security controls and services such as firewall and Intrusion Detection Prevention System (IDPS) in the protection of Supervisory and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The methodology used is Plan-Do-Check-Act process model. The proposed technical security metric provides guidance for SCADA owners in complying with requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS) standard. The proposed model should be able to provide a comprehensive measurement and prove the effectiveness of ISO/IEC 27004 ISMS Measurement standard.

AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate the application of trusted computing to securing peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. We identify a central challenge in providing many of the security services within these networks, namely the absence of stable verifiable peer identities. We employ the functionalities provided by trusted computing technology to establish a pseudonymous authentication scheme for peers and extend this scheme to build secure channels between peers for future communications. In support of our work, we illustrate how commands from the trusted computing group (TCG) specifications can be used to implement our approach in P2P networks.

AB  - This paper presents RecIF, a forensic technique for the analysis of business process logs to detect illegal data flows. RecIF uses propagation graphs to formally capture the data flow within a process execution. Abstracting away from the concrete traces, propagation graphs are analyzed with extensional data flow policies that denote what - instead of how - relevant industrial requirements, e.g. Chinese Wall and separation of duty constraints, are to be achieved. An example and the corresponding runtime figures demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

AB  - Modern e-Health systems require advanced computing and storage capabilities, leading to the adoption of technologies like the grid and giving birth to novel health grid systems. In particular, intensive care medicine uses this paradigm when facing a high flow of data coming from intensive care unit's (ICU) inpatients just like demonstrated by the ICGrid system prototyped by the University of Cyprus. Unfortunately, moving an ICU patient's data from the traditionally isolated hospital's computing facilities to data grids via public networks (i.e., the Internet) makes it imperative to establish an integral and standardized security solution to avoid common attacks on the data and metadata being managed. Particular emphasis must be put on the patient's personal data, the protection of which is required by legislations in many countries of the European Union and the world in general. In this paper, we extend our previous research with the following contributions: 1) a mandatory access control model to protect patient's metadata; 2) a major security revision to our previously proposed privacy protocol by contributing with a &#x201C;quality of security&#x201D; quantitative metric to improve fragmented data's assurance; and finally, 3) a set of early results to demonstrate that our protocol not only improves a patient personal data's security and privacy but also achieves a performance comparable with existing approaches.

AB  - The market for cloud-based mobile application is growing rapidly, according to recent industry research. Healthcare services are positively affected by the new technologies and availability of many e-health applications. Diagnostic medical imaging is one area where emerging systems are being developed to leverage the mobile-cloud infrastructure to increase the accessibility and lower the cost of these critical services. A framework was developed for mobile medical imaging devices and applications to securely communicate with a cloud-based image storage and management service using standard DICOM protocol. Prototype of a mobile ultrasound application running a tablet PC with a USB transducer is also developed to validate and evaluate the design.

AB  - In order to overcome the disadvantages of a central authority, a tendency is to move towards a peer-to-peer collaboration where control over data is given to users who can decide with whom they want to share their private data. In this peer-to-peer collaboration it is very difficult to ensure that after data is shared with other peers, these peers will not misbehave and violate data privacy. In this paper, we propose a mechanism that addresses the issue of data privacy violation by auditing the collaboration logs. In our approach, trust values between users are adjusted according to their previous activities on the shared data. Users share their private data by specifying some obligations the receivers are expected to follow. We log modifications done by users as well as the obligations and use a log-auditing mechanism to detect users who misbehaved. We adjust their associated trust values by using any existing decentralized trust model.

AB  - To investigate the exploitation and contamination by self-propagating Internet worms, a provenance-aware tracing mechanism is highly desirable. Provenance unawareness causes difficulties in fast, accurate identification of a worm&#146;s break-in point, and incurs significant log inspection overhead. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of process coloring, an efficient provenance-aware approach to worm break-in and contamination tracing. More specifically, process coloring assigns a "color", a unique system-wide identifier, to each remotely-accessible server or process. The color will then be either inherited by spawned child processes or diffused indirectly through process actions (e.g., read/write operations). Process coloring brings two major advantages: (1) It enables fast color-based identification of a worm&#146;s break-in point even before detailed log analysis; (2) It naturally partitions log data based on their colors, effectively reducing the volume of log data that need to be examined for worm investigation. A tamper-resistant log collection method is developed based on the virtual machine introspection technique. Our experiments with a number of real-world worms demonstrate the advantages of processing coloring.

AB  - The advent of cloud computing allows the provision of several commodities "as-a-service". For enterprise systems, a particularly interesting business model is the offer of configurable business processes for different consumers, which can then outsource their execution onto the cloud. Although such an outsourcing harbors a vast economic potential, both external and internal auditing pose a general challenge for their acceptance. This paper reviews the role of remote auditing as a means to address this issue and indicates research directions for automated tool support.

AB  - The Information communication Technologies (ICT) has assumed an important role in all domains of life today. The computation requirements are often larger than resources available at hand in an enterprise and it would like to outsource it for high speed computation or data management requirements. In other cases a small enterprise would like to lease computation or data archiving resources as per demand. Cloud computing is a new paradigm which may be used to handle such situations. It offers a virtual environment at a small initial investment by entrepreneurs planning to develop large applications scalable as the scope and workload increases. The computer hardware and software are available in virtualized environments of cloud computing offering Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS) through Datacenters and Cloud Service Providers (CSP). The paradigm shift provides elastic infrastructure, efficiency of resource utilization, reduction in upfront capital investment and focus on core activities. A model for cloud computing for telemedic services is being developed to cater for large data archive of Clinical Data Records (CDR), Decision Support Systems (DSS) and event based notification and monitoring system in a typical hospital. In this paper we have reviewed the rapid growth in cloud computing activities, available opportunities and services with the early birds in this technology. Beside this the hospital information and medical data services architecture using cloud services has been discussed in the context of the model being developed. Data storage service, Security service, scalability and performance issues have been discussed.

AB  - Cloud computing enables the use of Internet services as - needed basis. An important issue in the cloud is assuring privacy for the data stored in the cloud. There is a great challenge in providing security for the data shared in cloud and also prevent leakage of confidential data. To overcome this problem we introduce a novel approach with more secured CIA framework. We introduce auditing mechanisms and for providing trust for cloud users. Logs are maintained and sent periodically to the data owner. To provide security for the data file we encode the file using Base64 algorithm. This paper discusses key challenges in achieving privacy and trust based cloud through the use of secured detecting mechanisms which monitors the actions in cloud via technical and policy-based approaches.

AB  - We propose an efficient and flexible system for a secure and authentic data exchange in a multiinstitutional environment, where the institutions maintain different databases and provide secure and limited access services to employees of other institutions. The main motivation for building such a system was to organize efficient cooperative use of state registers, in order to increase the efficiency and quality of public services in Estonia. In order to meet high security requirements, several contemporary measures are integrated (using digital signatures, distributing certificate information by means of DNS protocol and linking log files with cryptographic checksums). We give rationale for the design decisions made in the implementation process and conclude with the current state of public use of the resulting infrastructure.

AB  - This paper describes a case study of Honey pot deployment in an organizational network. As per Wikipedia &#x201C;honey pot is a trap that is set to detect, deflect, or in some manner counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems&#x201D;. These traps could be any digital resource ranging from a single computer to a network of such computers or a network application that appears to be a part of organizational network resources but is actually a fake resource with no production traffic. Further these resources are closely monitored and the traffic to and from these resources is well under the control of the administrator. In the experiment performed in this paper, such a trap is laid in the form of a low interaction honeypot honeyd in the perimeter security of an organizational network. The results of deployment are presented and further various props and cons of such deployments are brought about.

AB  - Today's forensic techniques for databases are primarily focused on logging mechanisms and artifacts accessible in the database management systems (DBMSs). While log files, plan caches, cache clock hands, etc. can reveal past transactions, a malicious administrator's modifications might be much more difficult to detect, because he can cover his tracks by also manipulating the log files and flushing transient artifacts such as caches. The internal structure of the data storage inside databases, however, has not yet received much attention from the digital forensic research community. In this paper, we want to show that the diversity of B<sup>+</sup>-Trees, a widely used data structure in today's database storage engines, enables a deep insight of the database's history. Hidden manipulations such as predated INSERT operations in a logging database can be revealed by our approach. We introduce novel forensic techniques for B<sup>+</sup>-Trees that are based on characteristics of the tree structure and show how database management systems would have to be modified to even better support tree forensic techniques.
